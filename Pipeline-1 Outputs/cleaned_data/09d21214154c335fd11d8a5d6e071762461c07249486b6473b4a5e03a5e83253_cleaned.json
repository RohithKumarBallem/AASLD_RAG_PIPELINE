This article will summarize practice guidance/guidelines put forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in an easy‐to‐read format for patients and their caregivers. The difference between guidance and guidelines is thatguidelinesare supported by very strong evidence, such as large randomized trials, whereasguidancestatements are supported by smaller studies and expert opinion.

The full document is available online at:https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.31065.1Autoimmune Hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks the liver by mistake (Fig.1). This immune attack leads to inflammation in the liver, which can eventually lead to damage, such as cirrhosis and liver failure. However, there are treatments that can prevent this damage in most cases. FIG 1:Mechanism of Autoimmune Hepatitis. Courtesy Aria Puri. Diagnosis Guidance statement:The diagnosis of AIH requires compatible histological findings and is further supported by the following features: (1) elevated serum aminotransaminase levels; (2) elevated serum immunoglobulin G (Ig G) level and/or positive serological marker(s); (3) exclusion of viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug‐induced diseases that may resemble AIH. Patient summary: AIH is diagnosed in patients with elevated liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), positive autoantibodies in the blood (Ig G level, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody [SMA]), other liver diseases ruled out (such as hepatitis B and C), and typical findings on liver biopsy. There is no single test to make the diagnosis but rather a combination of tests. Twenty percent (one in five cases) of patients with AIH do not have any autoantibodies. Figure2shows how AIH is diagnosed. FIG 2:Approach to diagnosing AIH in adults. Key Point: AIH should not be diagnosed without liver biopsy. Treatment Guidelines:For children and adults who present with AIH who do not have cirrhosis or acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests as initial first‐line treatment budesonide and azathioprine (AZA) or prednisone/prednisolone and AZA. For children and adults with AIH who have cirrhosis or who present with acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests that budesonide not be used. Patient summary: Initial treatment of AIH is with steroids (prednisone or budesonide) and AZA. Budesonide is great because it works like prednisone on the AIH, but most patients do not experience all the steroid side effects (weight gain, puffy face, thin bones, etc.). However, budesonide cannot be used in patients with cirrhosis or acute severe AIH. Key Point: Ask your doctor if budesonide is an option for you, to help minimize side effects! Guidelines:In children or adults with AIH who experience treatment failure, incomplete response, or drug intolerance to first‐line agents, the AASLD suggests the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus to achieve and maintain biochemical remission. Based on a superior ease of use and side‐effect profile, the AASLD suggests a trial of MMF over tacrolimus as the initial second‐line agent in patients with AIH. Patient summary: Most patients with AIH respond well to steroids and AZA, with the liver blood tests becoming normal within several months. However, in some patients, the inflammation is more difficult to treat. In these cases, mycophenolate is usually tried next and then tacrolimus. Figure3shows the different drugs and investigational treatments used to treat AIH. FIG 3:Treatment for AIH. Key Point: If your disease does not get under control right away, do not give up! Guidance statements:Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long‐term treatment‐free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and Ig G levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for relapse with regular laboratory assessments during the first 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long‐term maintenance regimen. Patient summary: The goal of treatment is to eliminate the inflammation, which means normal liver blood tests (AST and ALT) and normal Ig G level. Some, but not all, patients can get off of medications completely and still have normal liver blood tests. The chances for success are higher if the enzymes and Ig G are normal for 2 years first. Sometimes repeat liver biopsy is helpful, but it is not always required. Liver biopsy is usually done if the liver enzymes do not normalize, or to look for other causes, such as fatty liver. Up to 80% of patients will have their immune disease become active after medications are stopped (Fig.4). It is not easy to predict when this will occur, although it often happens in the first year. Because it could occur months to years after treatment has been stopped, liver blood tests to check for relapse must be done at regular intervals forever. FIG 4:Response to AIH treatment.

This immune attack leads to inflammation in the liver, which can eventually lead to damage, such as cirrhosis and liver failure. However, there are treatments that can prevent this damage in most cases. FIG 1:Mechanism of Autoimmune Hepatitis. Courtesy Aria Puri. Diagnosis Guidance statement:The diagnosis of AIH requires compatible histological findings and is further supported by the following features: (1) elevated serum aminotransaminase levels; (2) elevated serum immunoglobulin G (Ig G) level and/or positive serological marker(s); (3) exclusion of viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug‐induced diseases that may resemble AIH. Patient summary: AIH is diagnosed in patients with elevated liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), positive autoantibodies in the blood (Ig G level, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody [SMA]), other liver diseases ruled out (such as hepatitis B and C), and typical findings on liver biopsy. There is no single test to make the diagnosis but rather a combination of tests. Twenty percent (one in five cases) of patients with AIH do not have any autoantibodies. Figure2shows how AIH is diagnosed. FIG 2:Approach to diagnosing AIH in adults. Key Point: AIH should not be diagnosed without liver biopsy. Treatment Guidelines:For children and adults who present with AIH who do not have cirrhosis or acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests as initial first‐line treatment budesonide and azathioprine (AZA) or prednisone/prednisolone and AZA. For children and adults with AIH who have cirrhosis or who present with acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests that budesonide not be used. Patient summary: Initial treatment of AIH is with steroids (prednisone or budesonide) and AZA. Budesonide is great because it works like prednisone on the AIH, but most patients do not experience all the steroid side effects (weight gain, puffy face, thin bones, etc.). However, budesonide cannot be used in patients with cirrhosis or acute severe AIH. Key Point: Ask your doctor if budesonide is an option for you, to help minimize side effects! Guidelines:In children or adults with AIH who experience treatment failure, incomplete response, or drug intolerance to first‐line agents, the AASLD suggests the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus to achieve and maintain biochemical remission. Based on a superior ease of use and side‐effect profile, the AASLD suggests a trial of MMF over tacrolimus as the initial second‐line agent in patients with AIH. Patient summary: Most patients with AIH respond well to steroids and AZA, with the liver blood tests becoming normal within several months. However, in some patients, the inflammation is more difficult to treat. In these cases, mycophenolate is usually tried next and then tacrolimus. Figure3shows the different drugs and investigational treatments used to treat AIH. FIG 3:Treatment for AIH. Key Point: If your disease does not get under control right away, do not give up! Guidance statements:Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long‐term treatment‐free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and Ig G levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for relapse with regular laboratory assessments during the first 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long‐term maintenance regimen. Patient summary: The goal of treatment is to eliminate the inflammation, which means normal liver blood tests (AST and ALT) and normal Ig G level. Some, but not all, patients can get off of medications completely and still have normal liver blood tests. The chances for success are higher if the enzymes and Ig G are normal for 2 years first. Sometimes repeat liver biopsy is helpful, but it is not always required. Liver biopsy is usually done if the liver enzymes do not normalize, or to look for other causes, such as fatty liver. Up to 80% of patients will have their immune disease become active after medications are stopped (Fig.4). It is not easy to predict when this will occur, although it often happens in the first year. Because it could occur months to years after treatment has been stopped, liver blood tests to check for relapse must be done at regular intervals forever. FIG 4:Response to AIH treatment.

Based on a superior ease of use and side‐effect profile, the AASLD suggests a trial of MMF over tacrolimus as the initial second‐line agent in patients with AIH. Patient summary: Most patients with AIH respond well to steroids and AZA, with the liver blood tests becoming normal within several months. However, in some patients, the inflammation is more difficult to treat. In these cases, mycophenolate is usually tried next and then tacrolimus. Figure3shows the different drugs and investigational treatments used to treat AIH. FIG 3:Treatment for AIH. Key Point: If your disease does not get under control right away, do not give up! Guidance statements:Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long‐term treatment‐free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and Ig G levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for relapse with regular laboratory assessments during the first 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long‐term maintenance regimen. Patient summary: The goal of treatment is to eliminate the inflammation, which means normal liver blood tests (AST and ALT) and normal Ig G level. Some, but not all, patients can get off of medications completely and still have normal liver blood tests. The chances for success are higher if the enzymes and Ig G are normal for 2 years first. Sometimes repeat liver biopsy is helpful, but it is not always required. Liver biopsy is usually done if the liver enzymes do not normalize, or to look for other causes, such as fatty liver. Up to 80% of patients will have their immune disease become active after medications are stopped (Fig.4). It is not easy to predict when this will occur, although it often happens in the first year. Because it could occur months to years after treatment has been stopped, liver blood tests to check for relapse must be done at regular intervals forever. FIG 4:Response to AIH treatment.

This article will summarize practice guidance/guidelines put forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in an easy‐to‐read format for patients and their caregivers.

The full document is available online at:https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.31065.1Autoimmune Hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks the liver by mistake (Fig.1). This immune attack leads to inflammation in the liver, which can eventually lead to damage, such as cirrhosis and liver failure. However, there are treatments that can prevent this damage in most cases. FIG 1:Mechanism of Autoimmune Hepatitis. Courtesy Aria Puri. Diagnosis Guidance statement:The diagnosis of AIH requires compatible histological findings and is further supported by the following features: (1) elevated serum aminotransaminase levels; (2) elevated serum immunoglobulin G (Ig G) level and/or positive serological marker(s); (3) exclusion of viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug‐induced diseases that may resemble AIH. Patient summary: AIH is diagnosed in patients with elevated liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), positive autoantibodies in the blood (Ig G level, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody [SMA]), other liver diseases ruled out (such as hepatitis B and C), and typical findings on liver biopsy. There is no single test to make the diagnosis but rather a combination of tests. Twenty percent (one in five cases) of patients with AIH do not have any autoantibodies. Figure2shows how AIH is diagnosed. FIG 2:Approach to diagnosing AIH in adults. Key Point: AIH should not be diagnosed without liver biopsy. Treatment Guidelines:For children and adults who present with AIH who do not have cirrhosis or acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests as initial first‐line treatment budesonide and azathioprine (AZA) or prednisone/prednisolone and AZA. For children and adults with AIH who have cirrhosis or who present with acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests that budesonide not be used. Patient summary: Initial treatment of AIH is with steroids (prednisone or budesonide) and AZA. Budesonide is great because it works like prednisone on the AIH, but most patients do not experience all the steroid side effects (weight gain, puffy face, thin bones, etc.). However, budesonide cannot be used in patients with cirrhosis or acute severe AIH. Key Point: Ask your doctor if budesonide is an option for you, to help minimize side effects! Guidelines:In children or adults with AIH who experience treatment failure, incomplete response, or drug intolerance to first‐line agents, the AASLD suggests the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus to achieve and maintain biochemical remission.

Guidelines:In children or adults with AIH who experience treatment failure, incomplete response, or drug intolerance to first‐line agents, the AASLD suggests the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus to achieve and maintain biochemical remission. Based on a superior ease of use and side‐effect profile, the AASLD suggests a trial of MMF over tacrolimus as the initial second‐line agent in patients with AIH. Patient summary: Most patients with AIH respond well to steroids and AZA, with the liver blood tests becoming normal within several months. However, in some patients, the inflammation is more difficult to treat. In these cases, mycophenolate is usually tried next and then tacrolimus. Figure3shows the different drugs and investigational treatments used to treat AIH. FIG 3:Treatment for AIH. Key Point: If your disease does not get under control right away, do not give up! Guidance statements:Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long‐term treatment‐free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and Ig G levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for relapse with regular laboratory assessments during the first 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long‐term maintenance regimen. Patient summary: The goal of treatment is to eliminate the inflammation, which means normal liver blood tests (AST and ALT) and normal Ig G level. Some, but not all, patients can get off of medications completely and still have normal liver blood tests. The chances for success are higher if the enzymes and Ig G are normal for 2 years first. Sometimes repeat liver biopsy is helpful, but it is not always required. Liver biopsy is usually done if the liver enzymes do not normalize, or to look for other causes, such as fatty liver. Up to 80% of patients will have their immune disease become active after medications are stopped (Fig.4). It is not easy to predict when this will occur, although it often happens in the first year. Because it could occur months to years after treatment has been stopped, liver blood tests to check for relapse must be done at regular intervals forever. FIG 4:Response to AIH treatment.

This article will summarize practice guidance/guidelines put forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in an easy‐to‐read format for patients and their caregivers. The difference between guidance and guidelines is thatguidelinesare supported by very strong evidence, such as large randomized trials, whereasguidancestatements are supported by smaller studies and expert opinion.

The full document is available online at:https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.31065.1Autoimmune Hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks the liver by mistake (Fig.1). This immune attack leads to inflammation in the liver, which can eventually lead to damage, such as cirrhosis and liver failure. However, there are treatments that can prevent this damage in most cases. FIG 1:Mechanism of Autoimmune Hepatitis. Courtesy Aria Puri. Diagnosis Guidance statement:The diagnosis of AIH requires compatible histological findings and is further supported by the following features: (1) elevated serum aminotransaminase levels; (2) elevated serum immunoglobulin G (Ig G) level and/or positive serological marker(s); (3) exclusion of viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug‐induced diseases that may resemble AIH. Patient summary: AIH is diagnosed in patients with elevated liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), positive autoantibodies in the blood (Ig G level, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody [SMA]), other liver diseases ruled out (such as hepatitis B and C), and typical findings on liver biopsy. There is no single test to make the diagnosis but rather a combination of tests. Twenty percent (one in five cases) of patients with AIH do not have any autoantibodies. Figure2shows how AIH is diagnosed. FIG 2:Approach to diagnosing AIH in adults. Key Point: AIH should not be diagnosed without liver biopsy. Treatment Guidelines:For children and adults who present with AIH who do not have cirrhosis or acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests as initial first‐line treatment budesonide and azathioprine (AZA) or prednisone/prednisolone and AZA. For children and adults with AIH who have cirrhosis or who present with acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests that budesonide not be used.

Treatment Guidelines:For children and adults who present with AIH who do not have cirrhosis or acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests as initial first‐line treatment budesonide and azathioprine (AZA) or prednisone/prednisolone and AZA. For children and adults with AIH who have cirrhosis or who present with acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests that budesonide not be used. Patient summary: Initial treatment of AIH is with steroids (prednisone or budesonide) and AZA. Budesonide is great because it works like prednisone on the AIH, but most patients do not experience all the steroid side effects (weight gain, puffy face, thin bones, etc.). However, budesonide cannot be used in patients with cirrhosis or acute severe AIH. Key Point: Ask your doctor if budesonide is an option for you, to help minimize side effects! Guidelines:In children or adults with AIH who experience treatment failure, incomplete response, or drug intolerance to first‐line agents, the AASLD suggests the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus to achieve and maintain biochemical remission. Based on a superior ease of use and side‐effect profile, the AASLD suggests a trial of MMF over tacrolimus as the initial second‐line agent in patients with AIH. Patient summary: Most patients with AIH respond well to steroids and AZA, with the liver blood tests becoming normal within several months. However, in some patients, the inflammation is more difficult to treat. In these cases, mycophenolate is usually tried next and then tacrolimus. Figure3shows the different drugs and investigational treatments used to treat AIH. FIG 3:Treatment for AIH. Key Point: If your disease does not get under control right away, do not give up! Guidance statements:Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long‐term treatment‐free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and Ig G levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for relapse with regular laboratory assessments during the first 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long‐term maintenance regimen. Patient summary: The goal of treatment is to eliminate the inflammation, which means normal liver blood tests (AST and ALT) and normal Ig G level. Some, but not all, patients can get off of medications completely and still have normal liver blood tests. The chances for success are higher if the enzymes and Ig G are normal for 2 years first. Sometimes repeat liver biopsy is helpful, but it is not always required. Liver biopsy is usually done if the liver enzymes do not normalize, or to look for other causes, such as fatty liver. Up to 80% of patients will have their immune disease become active after medications are stopped (Fig.4). It is not easy to predict when this will occur, although it often happens in the first year. Because it could occur months to years after treatment has been stopped, liver blood tests to check for relapse must be done at regular intervals forever. FIG 4:Response to AIH treatment.

This immune attack leads to inflammation in the liver, which can eventually lead to damage, such as cirrhosis and liver failure. However, there are treatments that can prevent this damage in most cases. FIG 1:Mechanism of Autoimmune Hepatitis. Courtesy Aria Puri. Diagnosis Guidance statement:The diagnosis of AIH requires compatible histological findings and is further supported by the following features: (1) elevated serum aminotransaminase levels; (2) elevated serum immunoglobulin G (Ig G) level and/or positive serological marker(s); (3) exclusion of viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug‐induced diseases that may resemble AIH. Patient summary: AIH is diagnosed in patients with elevated liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), positive autoantibodies in the blood (Ig G level, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody [SMA]), other liver diseases ruled out (such as hepatitis B and C), and typical findings on liver biopsy.

Budesonide is great because it works like prednisone on the AIH, but most patients do not experience all the steroid side effects (weight gain, puffy face, thin bones, etc.). However, budesonide cannot be used in patients with cirrhosis or acute severe AIH. Key Point: Ask your doctor if budesonide is an option for you, to help minimize side effects! Guidelines:In children or adults with AIH who experience treatment failure, incomplete response, or drug intolerance to first‐line agents, the AASLD suggests the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus to achieve and maintain biochemical remission. Based on a superior ease of use and side‐effect profile, the AASLD suggests a trial of MMF over tacrolimus as the initial second‐line agent in patients with AIH. Patient summary: Most patients with AIH respond well to steroids and AZA, with the liver blood tests becoming normal within several months. However, in some patients, the inflammation is more difficult to treat. In these cases, mycophenolate is usually tried next and then tacrolimus. Figure3shows the different drugs and investigational treatments used to treat AIH. FIG 3:Treatment for AIH. Key Point: If your disease does not get under control right away, do not give up! Guidance statements:Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long‐term treatment‐free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and Ig G levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for relapse with regular laboratory assessments during the first 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long‐term maintenance regimen. Patient summary: The goal of treatment is to eliminate the inflammation, which means normal liver blood tests (AST and ALT) and normal Ig G level. Some, but not all, patients can get off of medications completely and still have normal liver blood tests. The chances for success are higher if the enzymes and Ig G are normal for 2 years first. Sometimes repeat liver biopsy is helpful, but it is not always required. Liver biopsy is usually done if the liver enzymes do not normalize, or to look for other causes, such as fatty liver. Up to 80% of patients will have their immune disease become active after medications are stopped (Fig.4). It is not easy to predict when this will occur, although it often happens in the first year. Because it could occur months to years after treatment has been stopped, liver blood tests to check for relapse must be done at regular intervals forever. FIG 4:Response to AIH treatment.

This article will summarize practice guidance/guidelines put forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in an easy‐to‐read format for patients and their caregivers.

The full document is available online at:https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.31065.1Autoimmune Hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks the liver by mistake (Fig.1). This immune attack leads to inflammation in the liver, which can eventually lead to damage, such as cirrhosis and liver failure. However, there are treatments that can prevent this damage in most cases. FIG 1:Mechanism of Autoimmune Hepatitis. Courtesy Aria Puri. Diagnosis Guidance statement:The diagnosis of AIH requires compatible histological findings and is further supported by the following features: (1) elevated serum aminotransaminase levels; (2) elevated serum immunoglobulin G (Ig G) level and/or positive serological marker(s); (3) exclusion of viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug‐induced diseases that may resemble AIH. Patient summary: AIH is diagnosed in patients with elevated liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), positive autoantibodies in the blood (Ig G level, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody [SMA]), other liver diseases ruled out (such as hepatitis B and C), and typical findings on liver biopsy. There is no single test to make the diagnosis but rather a combination of tests. Twenty percent (one in five cases) of patients with AIH do not have any autoantibodies. Figure2shows how AIH is diagnosed. FIG 2:Approach to diagnosing AIH in adults. Key Point: AIH should not be diagnosed without liver biopsy. Treatment Guidelines:For children and adults who present with AIH who do not have cirrhosis or acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests as initial first‐line treatment budesonide and azathioprine (AZA) or prednisone/prednisolone and AZA.

For children and adults with AIH who have cirrhosis or who present with acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests that budesonide not be used. Patient summary: Initial treatment of AIH is with steroids (prednisone or budesonide) and AZA. Budesonide is great because it works like prednisone on the AIH, but most patients do not experience all the steroid side effects (weight gain, puffy face, thin bones, etc.). However, budesonide cannot be used in patients with cirrhosis or acute severe AIH. Key Point: Ask your doctor if budesonide is an option for you, to help minimize side effects! Guidelines:In children or adults with AIH who experience treatment failure, incomplete response, or drug intolerance to first‐line agents, the AASLD suggests the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus to achieve and maintain biochemical remission. Based on a superior ease of use and side‐effect profile, the AASLD suggests a trial of MMF over tacrolimus as the initial second‐line agent in patients with AIH. Patient summary: Most patients with AIH respond well to steroids and AZA, with the liver blood tests becoming normal within several months. However, in some patients, the inflammation is more difficult to treat. In these cases, mycophenolate is usually tried next and then tacrolimus. Figure3shows the different drugs and investigational treatments used to treat AIH. FIG 3:Treatment for AIH. Key Point: If your disease does not get under control right away, do not give up! Guidance statements:Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long‐term treatment‐free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and Ig G levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for relapse with regular laboratory assessments during the first 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long‐term maintenance regimen. Patient summary: The goal of treatment is to eliminate the inflammation, which means normal liver blood tests (AST and ALT) and normal Ig G level. Some, but not all, patients can get off of medications completely and still have normal liver blood tests. The chances for success are higher if the enzymes and Ig G are normal for 2 years first. Sometimes repeat liver biopsy is helpful, but it is not always required. Liver biopsy is usually done if the liver enzymes do not normalize, or to look for other causes, such as fatty liver. Up to 80% of patients will have their immune disease become active after medications are stopped (Fig.4). It is not easy to predict when this will occur, although it often happens in the first year. Because it could occur months to years after treatment has been stopped, liver blood tests to check for relapse must be done at regular intervals forever. FIG 4:Response to AIH treatment.

The full document is available online at:https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.31065.1Autoimmune Hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks the liver by mistake (Fig.1). This immune attack leads to inflammation in the liver, which can eventually lead to damage, such as cirrhosis and liver failure. However, there are treatments that can prevent this damage in most cases. FIG 1:Mechanism of Autoimmune Hepatitis. Courtesy Aria Puri. Diagnosis Guidance statement:The diagnosis of AIH requires compatible histological findings and is further supported by the following features: (1) elevated serum aminotransaminase levels; (2) elevated serum immunoglobulin G (Ig G) level and/or positive serological marker(s); (3) exclusion of viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug‐induced diseases that may resemble AIH. Patient summary: AIH is diagnosed in patients with elevated liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), positive autoantibodies in the blood (Ig G level, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody [SMA]), other liver diseases ruled out (such as hepatitis B and C), and typical findings on liver biopsy. There is no single test to make the diagnosis but rather a combination of tests. Twenty percent (one in five cases) of patients with AIH do not have any autoantibodies.

          "Patient summary: AIH is diagnosed in patients with elevated liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), positive autoantibodies in the blood (Ig G level, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody [SMA]), other liver diseases ruled out (such as hepatitis B and C), and typical findings on liver biopsy.

For children and adults with AIH who have cirrhosis or who present with acute severe AIH, the AASLD suggests that budesonide not be used.",
          "Patient summary: Initial treatment of AIH is with steroids (prednisone or budesonide) and AZA. Budesonide is great because it works like prednisone on the AIH, but most patients do not experience all the steroid side effects (weight gain, puffy face, thin bones, etc.). However, budesonide cannot be used in patients with cirrhosis or acute severe AIH.",
          "Key Point: Ask your doctor if budesonide is an option for you, to help minimize side effects!",
          "Guidelines:In children or adults with AIH who experience treatment failure, incomplete response, or drug intolerance to first‐line agents, the AASLD suggests the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus to achieve and maintain biochemical remission. Based on a superior ease of use and side‐effect profile, the AASLD suggests a trial of MMF over tacrolimus as the initial second‐line agent in patients with AIH.",
          "Patient summary: Most patients with AIH respond well to steroids and AZA, with the liver blood tests becoming normal within several months. However, in some patients, the inflammation is more difficult to treat. In these cases, mycophenolate is usually tried next and then tacrolimus.

Some, but not all, patients can get off of medications completely and still have normal liver blood tests. The chances for success are higher if the enzymes and Ig G are normal for 2 years first. Sometimes repeat liver biopsy is helpful, but it is not always required. Liver biopsy is usually done if the liver enzymes do not normalize, or to look for other causes, such as fatty liver. Up to 80% of patients will have their immune disease become active after medications are stopped (Fig.4). It is not easy to predict when this will occur, although it often happens in the first year. Because it could occur months to years after treatment has been stopped, liver blood tests to check for relapse must be done at regular intervals forever.",
