Liver Transplantation():10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715, August 22, 2025.|DOI:10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715Free SDCPAPACCEPTED MSAbstract Background and Aim: Advances in immunosuppression and surgical techniques in liver transplantation (LT) have significantly improved patient outcomes, but donor utilization and access to LT remain a challenge. The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases. -Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases. and the American Society of Transplantation The 2024 ILTS-ILCA consensus recommendations for liver transplantation for HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma The rising cost of liver transplantation in the United States Plasma exchange for acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis - Volume - Issue Previous Abstract Next Abstract Export to RISExport to End Note More Cite Permissions Export All Images to Power Point File Add to My Favorites Your Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).

Liver Transplantation():10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715, August 22, 2025.|DOI:10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715Free SDCPAPACCEPTED MSAbstract Background and Aim: Advances in immunosuppression and surgical techniques in liver transplantation (LT) have significantly improved patient outcomes, but donor utilization and access to LT remain a challenge. The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases..

Liver Transplantation():10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715, August 22, 2025.|DOI:10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715Free SDCPAPACCEPTED MSAbstract Background and Aim: Advances in immunosuppression and surgical techniques in liver transplantation (LT) have significantly improved patient outcomes, but donor utilization and access to LT remain a challenge. The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases..

Liver Transplantation():10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715, August 22, 2025.|DOI:10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715 ACCEPTED MS Background and Aim: Advances in immunosuppression and surgical techniques in liver transplantation (LT) have significantly improved patient outcomes, but donor utilization and access to LT remain a challenge. The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases.

The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases. and the American Society of Transplantation The 2024 ILTS-ILCA consensus recommendations for liver transplantation for HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma The rising cost of liver transplantation in the United States Plasma exchange for acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis",

Liver Transplantation():10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715, August 22, 2025.|DOI:10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715Free SDCPAPACCEPTED MSAbstract Background and Aim: Advances in immunosuppression and surgical techniques in liver transplantation (LT) have significantly improved patient outcomes, but donor utilization and access to LT remain a challenge. The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases. and the American Society of Transplantation The 2024 ILTS-ILCA consensus recommendations for liver transplantation for HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma The rising cost of liver transplantation in the United States Plasma exchange for acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis",

Liver Transplantation():10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715, August 22, 2025.|DOI:10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715Free SDCPAPACCEPTED MSAbstract Background and Aim: Advances in immunosuppression and surgical techniques in liver transplantation (LT) have significantly improved patient outcomes, but donor utilization and access to LT remain a challenge. The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases..

Liver Transplantation():10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715, August 22, 2025.|DOI:10.1097/LVT.0000000000000715Free SDCPAPACCEPTED MSAbstract Background and Aim: Advances in immunosuppression and surgical techniques in liver transplantation (LT) have significantly improved patient outcomes, but donor utilization and access to LT remain a challenge. The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases..",

Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine.

The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases.",
