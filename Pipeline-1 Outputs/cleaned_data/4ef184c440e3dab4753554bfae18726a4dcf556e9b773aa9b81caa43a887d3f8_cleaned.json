The full document is available online at:https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.30145. Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Potential conflict of interest: Nothing to report. This article will summarize practice guidance/guidelines put forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in an easy‐to‐read format for patients and their caregivers. The difference between guidance and guidelines is thatguidelinesare supported by very strong evidence, such as large, randomized trials, whileguidance statementsare supported by smaller studies and expert opinion.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates.

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Potential conflict of interest: Nothing to report. This article will summarize practice guidance/guidelines put forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in an easy‐to‐read format for patients and their caregivers. The difference between guidance and guidelines is thatguidelinesare supported by very strong evidence, such as large, randomized trials, whileguidance statementsare supported by smaller studies and expert opinion. This summary will hopefully help patients better understand their condition, but it should not replace expert medical care. The full document is available online at:https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.30145. Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins.

If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC.

Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended.

Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist.

(A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism.

Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements: Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement: Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

E‐mail:hyosun.han@med.usc.edu Clinical Liver Disease18(5):p 255-259, November 2021.|DOI:10.1002/cld.1158Correction added on 15 October 2021, after first online publication: The article title was corrected. Potential conflict of interest: Nothing to report. This article will summarize practice guidance/guidelines put forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in an easy‐to‐read format for patients and their caregivers. The difference between guidance and guidelines is thatguidelinesare supported by very strong evidence, such as large, randomized trials, whileguidance statementsare supported by smaller studies and expert opinion. This summary will hopefully help patients better understand their condition, but it should not replace expert medical care. The full document is available online at:https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.30145. Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1). TABLE 1 -Commonly Used Medications for PBCSign/Symptom Medication(s)Type/Class Notes Abnormal liver tests UDCABile acid First‐line treatment for PBCOCABile acid For those who do not fully respond to UDCA; should not be used in people with decompensated cirrhosis Bezafibrate Fibrate Should not be used in people with decompensated cirrhosis Fenofibrate Itchiness (pruritus)Cholestyramine Anion‐exchange resin Bind and remove substances in blood that cause itching Colestipol Colesevelam Rifampicin Antibiotic For itchiness that does not respond to first treatment Naltrexone Opioid antagonist For itchiness that does not respond to first treatment Sertraline Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor For itchiness that does not respond to first treatment Dry eyes and mouth Artificial tears Saline Rewetting of eyes Cyclosporine Immunosuppressant Decreases eye inflammation; may need ophthalmologist Lifitegrast Pilocarpine Acetylcholine receptor agonist Increases production of tears and saliva Cevimeline Guidance Statements:Patients with suspected cirrhosis should undergo endoscopic evaluation for varices at the time of diagnosis. Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal.

For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

TABLE 1 -Commonly Used Medications for PBCSign/Symptom Medication(s)Type/Class Notes Abnormal liver tests UDCABile acid First‐line treatment for PBCOCABile acid For those who do not fully respond to UDCA; should not be used in people with decompensated cirrhosis Bezafibrate Fibrate Should not be used in people with decompensated cirrhosis Fenofibrate Itchiness (pruritus)Cholestyramine Anion‐exchange resin Bind and remove substances in blood that cause itching Colestipol Colesevelam Rifampicin Antibiotic For itchiness that does not respond to first treatment Naltrexone Opioid antagonist For itchiness that does not respond to first treatment Sertraline Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor For itchiness that does not respond to first treatment Dry eyes and mouth Artificial tears Saline Rewetting of eyes Cyclosporine Immunosuppressant Decreases eye inflammation; may need ophthalmologist Lifitegrast Pilocarpine Acetylcholine receptor agonist Increases production of tears and saliva Cevimeline Guidance Statements:Patients with suspected cirrhosis should undergo endoscopic evaluation for varices at the time of diagnosis. Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Potential conflict of interest: Nothing to report. This article will summarize practice guidance/guidelines put forth by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in an easy‐to‐read format for patients and their caregivers.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system harms the liver. Specifically, the immune system mistakenly attacks bile ducts, which are tubes that carry bile and other substances from the liver into the intestines. In PBC, it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed. As the bile ducts are slowly destroyed, the substances they carry accumulate in the liver and blood, causing itching, fatigue, and issues with the body’s metabolism. In the late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis (end‐stage liver disease or fourth stage of scarring) and liver failure (Fig.1). FIG 1:Progression of disease in PBC. (A) Normal liver (blue) with biliary tree (green). (B) Autoimmune inflammation of small bile ducts causes damage and duct loss. (C) Over time, the liver becomes scarred and shrunken (cirrhosis). The direct cause of PBC is not completely known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. People with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment. However, most people respond very well to medical treatment. PBC is a chronic condition for which individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care. Diagnosis Guidance Statements:The diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met:Biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on ALP elevation Presence of AMA or other PBC‐specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210Histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts Liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal. Patient Summary:A diagnosis of PBC is considered if someone has an elevated liver‐associated blood test (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and/or a positive blood antibody test. The antibody tests include antimitochondrial (AMA) and PBC‐specific antinuclear antibody. If laboratory tests are inconclusive, a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristics of PBC. However, liver biopsy is rarely needed to establish a diagnosis. Because many other diseases can look like PBC, other evaluation including additional laboratory tests and imaging may be needed before receiving a final diagnosis (Fig.2). In particular, some people may have features of both PBC and another condition calledautoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy can help identify what features are present and may affect treatment decisions. FIG 2:Overview of diagnostic criteria for PBC. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC. Key Point:The diagnosis of PBC is a multistep process that requires several types of testing. It may take time for you to receive a final diagnosis. Treatment Guidance Statements:Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day orally is recommended for patients with PBC who have abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. For patients requiring bile acid sequestrants, UDCA should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant. Biochemical response to UDCA should be evaluated at 12 months after treatment initiation to determine whether patients should be considered for second‐line therapy. Patients who are inadequate responders to UDCA should be considered for treatment with OCA, starting at 5 mg/day. Fibrates can be considered off‐label alternatives for patients with PBC and inadequate response to UDCA. Use of OCA and fibrates is discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease. Patient Summary:For people with PBC and abnormal liver tests, UDCA is the main treatment and has been shown toslow disease progression. Because other PBC medications may affect the absorption of UDCA, it is important to take this medication as instructed. Using a standardized dose, UDCA is tried for 12 months to look for response. If liver tests remain high, obeticholic acid (OCA) therapy may be added. Another alternative for those who do not respond to UDCA alone is adding a type of lipid‐lowering medication called a fibrate (Fig.3). People with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., having symptoms such as abdominal swelling, confusion, jaundice, or gastrointestinal bleeding) should not take OCA or fibrates for treatment of PBC. FIG 3:Overview of general treatment strategy for PBC. Key Point:UDCA is the primary treatment for PBC. Depending on response to UDCA, additional medications may be added. Specifically, if liver tests do not normalize after 12 months, OCA or fibrates may be added. If you have decompensated cirrhosis, you should not take OCA or fibrates. Guidance Statements:Anion‐exchange resins should be used as initial therapy for patients with PBC who have pruritus. The following agents can be used for pruritus refractory to anion‐exchange resins:○Rifampicin 150 to 300 mg twice daily○Oral opiate antagonists such as naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50 mg daily○Sertraline 75 to 100 mg daily Patient Summary:Itchiness (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, is treated with medications called resins. Resins bind substances in the gut, preventing them from entering the blood and causing itching. If itching remains uncontrolled, patients can try other medications, such as rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Key Point:Itching is very common for people with PBC. You may need to try multiple medications to control your symptoms. Guidance Statements:Management of dry eyes can include the following:○Artificial tears should be used initially.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to artificial tears.○Cyclosporine or lifitegrast ophthalmic emulsion can be used in those whose disease is refractory to other agents, preferably under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. The following therapies should be used for xerostomia and dysphagia:○Over‐the‐counter saliva substitutes can be tried.○Pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. Patient Summary: People with PBC may also have a condition called sicca syndrome (dry eyes and mouth). For dry eyes, artificial tears are used as the first treatment. If symptoms persist, additional medications, such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, can be added. Dry eye that does not respond to these medications may require seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for further treatment. For dry mouth, saliva substitutes are tried first, but medications that stimulate saliva production (e.g., pilocarpine and cevimeline) can also be added. Key Point:Dry eyes and mouth are also known symptoms of PBC. There are several medications that can help (Table1).

Regular screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cross‐sectional imaging at 6‐month intervals is currently advised for men and patients with cirrhosis. Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found. Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC). Guidance Statements:Patients with PBC should be provided 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed. Oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or other effective bisphosphonates should be considered if patients are osteoporotic. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided if patients have acid reflux or known varices. Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis. Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this. Guidance Statements:Patients with elevated lipid levels and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be considered for lipid‐lowering therapy. Fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies should be treated with parenteral or water‐soluble supplements. Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these. Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help. Guidance Statement:Patients with manifestations of end‐stage PBC should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score exceeds 14. Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation. Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant. Acknowledgments CLDwould like to thank Cynthia Levy, M.

          "Guidance Statements:",
          "Patient Summary:If you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis related to your PBC, endoscopy to look for dilated veins in your esophagus is recommended. These veins (calledvarices) can break and cause life‐threatening bleeding. Endoscopy can find these veins early and treat them to prevent bleeding. Women with PBC‐associated cirrhosis and all men with PBC are at higher risk for liver cancer (HCC). Imaging of the liver every 6 months can detect early cancer and maximizes treatment options if cancer is found.",
          "Key Point:People with PBC and cirrhosis should undergo routine screening for esophageal varices and liver cancer (HCC).",
          "Guidance Statements:",
          "Patient Summary:PBC places individuals at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis (weak bones). Your hepatologist may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to prevent this from happening. If you have osteoporosis, the standard treatment (bisphosphonate therapy) is recommended. This treatment, as well as other types of osteoporosis therapies, may be prescribed to you by a primary care provider (PCP) or endocrinologist. Weight‐bearing exercise is also very important for the prevention of PBC‐associated osteoporosis.",
          "Keypoint:PBC increases the risk for development of osteoporosis. Vitamin D and calcium can help prevent this.",
          "Guidance Statements:",
          "Patient Summary:Although PBC may cause increased cholesterol levels, this does not significantly increase your risk for CVD. If you have other risk factors, such as family history of CVD or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend a cholesterol‐lowering medication. People with advanced PBC may have other low vitamin levels, so your hepatologist may check for these.",
          "Key Point:PBC can cause high cholesterol and low vitamin levels. Your hepatologist will check for these and may work with your PCP to prescribe medications to help.",
          "Guidance Statement:",
          "Patient Summary:For people with PBC, treatment with UDCA can reduce liver scarring and slow the scarring process. However, people who do not respond to UDCA can progress to cirrhosis and its associated complications. People with symptoms of end‐stage liver disease (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion) or liver cancer may need to be evaluated for liver transplantation.",
          "Key Point:If you have experienced cirrhosis‐related complications from PBC, your hepatologist may begin a liver transplantation evaluation or refer you to a center that performs transplantation. Not all people with PBC and cirrhosis need to be evaluated for transplant.",
