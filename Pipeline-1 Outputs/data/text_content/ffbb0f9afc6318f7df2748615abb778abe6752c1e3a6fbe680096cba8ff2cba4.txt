Michalopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, 200 Lothrop St., South BST S410, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, E‐mail:michalopoulosgk@upmc.edu, Fax: +1‐412‐648‐9846Hepatology69(4):p 1702-1718, April 2019.|DOI:10.1002/hep.30109BuyAbstractTCPOBOP (1,4‐Bis [2‐(3,5‐Dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene) is a constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) agonist that induces robust hepatocyte proliferation and hepatomegaly without any liver injury or tissue loss. TCPOBOP‐induced direct hyperplasia has been considered to be CAR‐dependent with no evidence of involvement of cytokines or growth factor signaling. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), MET and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are known to play a critical role in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, but their role in TCPOBOP‐induced direct hyperplasia, not yet explored, is investigated in the current study. Disruption of the RTK‐mediated signaling was achieved using MET knockout (KO) mice along with Canertinib treatment for EGFR inhibition. Combined elimination of MET and EGFR signaling [MET KO + EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi)], but not individual disruption, dramatically reduced TCPOBOP‐induced hepatomegaly and hepatocyte proliferation. TCPOBOP‐driven CAR activation was not altered in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice, as measured by nuclear CAR translocation and analysis of typical CAR target genes. However, TCPOBOP‐induced cell cycle activation was impaired in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice due to defective induction of cyclins, which regulate cell cycle initiation and progression. TCPOBOP‐driven induction of FOXM1, a key transcriptional regulator of cell cycle progression during TCPOBOP‐mediated hepatocyte proliferation, was greatly attenuated in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice. Interestingly, TCPOBOP treatment caused transient decline in hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha expression concomitant to proliferative response; this was not seen in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice. Transcriptomic profiling revealed the vast majority (~40%) of TCPOBOP‐dependent genes primarily related to proliferative response, but not to drug metabolism, were differentially expressed in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice.Conclusion:Taken together, combined disruption of EGFR and MET signaling lead to dramatic impairment of TCPOBOP‐induced proliferative response without altering CAR activation.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.Full Text Access for Subscribers:Individual SubscribersLog in for accessAASLD members log in hereAASLD members log in hereInstitutional UsersAccess through Ovid®Not a Subscriber?BuySubscribeRequest PermissionsBecome a Society MemberYou can read the full text of this article if you:Select an optionLog InBuy ArticleSubscribeSociety MembershipContent & PermissionsAccess through OvidLog InAccess through OvidSourceTCPOBOP‐Induced Hepatomegaly and Hepatocyte Proliferation are Attenuated by Combined Disruption of MET and EGFR SignalingHepatology69(4):1702-1718, April 2019.Full-SizeEmail+ FavoritesExportView in GalleryEmail to ColleagueColleague's E-mail is InvalidYour Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).Message:Thought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw in Hepatology.Your message has been successfully sent to your colleague.Some error has occurred while processing your request.

TCPOBOP‐induced direct hyperplasia has been considered to be CAR‐dependent with no evidence of involvement of cytokines or growth factor signaling. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), MET and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are known to play a critical role in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, but their role in TCPOBOP‐induced direct hyperplasia, not yet explored, is investigated in the current study. Disruption of the RTK‐mediated signaling was achieved using MET knockout (KO) mice along with Canertinib treatment for EGFR inhibition. Combined elimination of MET and EGFR signaling [MET KO + EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi)], but not individual disruption, dramatically reduced TCPOBOP‐induced hepatomegaly and hepatocyte proliferation. TCPOBOP‐driven CAR activation was not altered in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice, as measured by nuclear CAR translocation and analysis of typical CAR target genes. However, TCPOBOP‐induced cell cycle activation was impaired in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice due to defective induction of cyclins, which regulate cell cycle initiation and progression. TCPOBOP‐driven induction of FOXM1, a key transcriptional regulator of cell cycle progression during TCPOBOP‐mediated hepatocyte proliferation, was greatly attenuated in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice. Interestingly, TCPOBOP treatment caused transient decline in hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha expression concomitant to proliferative response; this was not seen in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice. Transcriptomic profiling revealed the vast majority (~40%) of TCPOBOP‐dependent genes primarily related to proliferative response, but not to drug metabolism, were differentially expressed in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice.Conclusion:Taken together, combined disruption of EGFR and MET signaling lead to dramatic impairment of TCPOBOP‐induced proliferative response without altering CAR activation.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.Full Text Access for Subscribers:Individual SubscribersLog in for accessAASLD members log in hereAASLD members log in hereInstitutional UsersAccess through Ovid®Not a Subscriber?BuySubscribeRequest PermissionsBecome a Society MemberYou can read the full text of this article if you:Select an optionLog InBuy ArticleSubscribeSociety MembershipContent & PermissionsAccess through OvidLog InAccess through OvidSourceTCPOBOP‐Induced Hepatomegaly and Hepatocyte Proliferation are Attenuated by Combined Disruption of MET and EGFR SignalingHepatology69(4):1702-1718, April 2019.Full-SizeEmail+ FavoritesExportView in GalleryEmail to ColleagueColleague's E-mail is InvalidYour Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).Message:Thought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw in Hepatology.Your message has been successfully sent to your colleague.Some error has occurred while processing your request.

TCPOBOP‐driven CAR activation was not altered in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice, as measured by nuclear CAR translocation and analysis of typical CAR target genes.

TCPOBOP‐driven induction of FOXM1, a key transcriptional regulator of cell cycle progression during TCPOBOP‐mediated hepatocyte proliferation, was greatly attenuated in [MET KO + EGFRi] mice.
