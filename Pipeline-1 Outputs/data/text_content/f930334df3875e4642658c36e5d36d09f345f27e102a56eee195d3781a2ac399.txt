The guideline panel developed structured questions following the Population, Intervention Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) framework. The panel addressed 6 PICO questions covering prevention (maternal to infant transmission and horizontal transmission), surveillance for liver cancer (among hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg) persons co-infected with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus and/or human immunodeficiency viruses and after HBsAg loss) and treatment (HBsAg positive persons in immune-tolerant or indeterminate phases as well as withdrawal of antiviral therapy), providing evidence-based recommendations on these topics. Four systematic reviews of the literature were conducted, and two existing systematic reviews were utilized to support the recommendations in this practice guideline.Conclusions:This evidence-based guideline provides updated recommendations to optimize the care of persons with CHB.Plain Language SummaryThis updated guideline offers evidence-based recommendations for managing chronic hepatitis B (CHB), using the GRADE approach. It addresses prevention, surveillance, and treatment, focusing on maternal-to-infant and horizontal transmission, liver cancer surveillance in HBsAg-positive individuals with co-infections, and treatment strategies for different phases of CHB. The guideline was developed following National Academy of Medicine standards, using structured PICO questions and supported by four systematic reviews and two existing systematic reviews. These recommendations aim to enhance care for individuals with CHB by providing clear guidance on prevention, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQCopyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.SourceAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BHepatology :  November 04, 2025Full-SizeEmail+ FavoritesExportView in GalleryEmail to ColleagueColleague's E-mail is InvalidYour Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).Message:Thought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw in Hepatology.Your message has been successfully sent to your colleague.Some error has occurred while processing your request.

The guideline panel developed structured questions following the Population, Intervention Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) framework. The panel addressed 6 PICO questions covering prevention (maternal to infant transmission and horizontal transmission), surveillance for liver cancer (among hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg) persons co-infected with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus and/or human immunodeficiency viruses and after HBsAg loss) and treatment (HBsAg positive persons in immune-tolerant or indeterminate phases as well as withdrawal of antiviral therapy), providing evidence-based recommendations on these topics. Four systematic reviews of the literature were conducted, and two existing systematic reviews were utilized to support the recommendations in this practice guideline.Conclusions:This evidence-based guideline provides updated recommendations to optimize the care of persons with CHB.Plain Language SummaryThis updated guideline offers evidence-based recommendations for managing chronic hepatitis B (CHB), using the GRADE approach.

The panel addressed 6 PICO questions covering prevention (maternal to infant transmission and horizontal transmission), surveillance for liver cancer (among hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg) persons co-infected with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus and/or human immunodeficiency viruses and after HBsAg loss) and treatment (HBsAg positive persons in immune-tolerant or indeterminate phases as well as withdrawal of antiviral therapy), providing evidence-based recommendations on these topics. Four systematic reviews of the literature were conducted, and two existing systematic reviews were utilized to support the recommendations in this practice guideline.Conclusions:This evidence-based guideline provides updated recommendations to optimize the care of persons with CHB.Plain Language SummaryThis updated guideline offers evidence-based recommendations for managing chronic hepatitis B (CHB), using the GRADE approach. It addresses prevention, surveillance, and treatment, focusing on maternal-to-infant and horizontal transmission, liver cancer surveillance in HBsAg-positive individuals with co-infections, and treatment strategies for different phases of CHB. The guideline was developed following National Academy of Medicine standards, using structured PICO questions and supported by four systematic reviews and two existing systematic reviews. These recommendations aim to enhance care for individuals with CHB by providing clear guidance on prevention, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQCopyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.SourceAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BHepatology :  November 04, 2025Full-SizeEmail+ FavoritesExportView in GalleryEmail to ColleagueColleague's E-mail is InvalidYour Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).Message:Thought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw in Hepatology.Your message has been successfully sent to your colleague.Some error has occurred while processing your request.

AbstractPlain Language Summary

Background and Aims:Accumulating data related to prevention, surveillance and treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) provided the impetus for this updated guideline, using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.Methods:The guideline was developed in compliance with the National Academy of Medicine standards. The guideline panel developed structured questions following the Population, Intervention Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) framework. The panel addressed 6 PICO questions covering prevention (maternal to infant transmission and horizontal transmission), surveillance for liver cancer (among hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg) persons co-infected with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus and/or human immunodeficiency viruses and after HBsAg loss) and treatment (HBsAg positive persons in immune-tolerant or indeterminate phases as well as withdrawal of antiviral therapy), providing evidence-based recommendations on these topics. Four systematic reviews of the literature were conducted, and two existing systematic reviews were utilized to support the recommendations in this practice guideline.Conclusions:This evidence-based guideline provides updated recommendations to optimize the care of persons with CHB.
