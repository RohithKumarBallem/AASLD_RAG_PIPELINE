To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2. Based on the structure of the PICO question, pooled results of the systematic review are organized by etiology and imaging-based modality.HCVFifty-four studies reported the accuracy of TE for staging fibrosis in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis (F2-4), a TE-LSM cutoff value of 7 kPa yielded a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 84%, whereas for advanced fibrosis (F3-4), a cutoff of 10 kPa had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 88%. To detect cirrhosis (F4), a TE-LSM cutoff of 13 kPa had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 94%. Regarding pSWE, 23 studies reported its accuracy to stage fibrosis in HCV.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies.

To detect cirrhosis (F4), a TE-LSM cutoff of 16.9 kPa had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 99%. Regarding pSWE, 1 study reported on its accuracy to stage fibrosis in PBC. For significant fibrosis (F2-4), a pSWE-LSM cutoff value of 1.5 m/s showed a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 77%, whereas for advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the 1.8 m/s threshold had a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 82%. To detect cirrhosis (F4), pSWE at a cutoff of 2 m/s had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 79%. Our search did not identify any study fulfilling the inclusion criteria on 2D-SWE or MRE exclusively dedicated to patients with PBC.PSCTwo studies reported the accuracy of TE for staging fibrosis in patients with PSC. For significant fibrosis (F2-4), a TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa yielded a sensitivity of 81%–89% and a specificity of 72%–88%, whereas for advanced fibrosis (F3-4), a cutoff of 9.6% kPa had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 82%–93%. To detect cirrhosis (F4), a TE-LSM cutoff of 14.4 kPa had a sensitivity of 69%–100% and a specificity of 88%–98%. Our search did not identify any manuscript on pSWE, 2D-SWE, or MRE exclusively dedicated to patients with PSC and fulfilling the inclusion criteria.Quality of evidenceAnalyses supporting PICO 1 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that mostly either had a low or moderate risk of bias. The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies.

To detect cirrhosis (F4), a TE-LSM cutoff of 14.4 kPa had a sensitivity of 69%–100% and a specificity of 88%–98%. Our search did not identify any manuscript on pSWE, 2D-SWE, or MRE exclusively dedicated to patients with PSC and fulfilling the inclusion criteria.Quality of evidenceAnalyses supporting PICO 1 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that mostly either had a low or moderate risk of bias. The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies.

To detect cirrhosis (F4), a TE-LSM cutoff of 14.4 kPa had a sensitivity of 69%–100% and a specificity of 88%–98%. Our search did not identify any manuscript on pSWE, 2D-SWE, or MRE exclusively dedicated to patients with PSC and fulfilling the inclusion criteria.Quality of evidenceAnalyses supporting PICO 1 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that mostly either had a low or moderate risk of bias. The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

Background and Aims:Transient elastography (TE), shear wave elastography, and/or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), each providing liver stiffness measurement (LSM), are the most studied imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA) techniques. To support the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on NILDA, we summarized the evidence on the accuracy of these LSM methods to stage liver fibrosis (F).Approach and Results:A comprehensive search for studies assessing LSM by TE, shear wave elastography, or MRE for the identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4), using histopathology as the standard of reference by liver disease etiology in adults or children from inception to April 2022 was performed. We excluded studies with <50 patients with a single disease entity and mixed liver disease etiologies (with the exception of HCV/HIV coinfection). Out of 9447 studies, 240 with 61,193 patients were included in this systematic review. In adults, sensitivities for the identification of F2-4 ranged from 51% to 95%, for F3-4 from 70% to 100%, and for F4 from 60% to 100% across all techniques/diseases, whereas specificities ranged from 36% to 100%, 74% to 100%, and 67% to 99%, respectively. The largest body of evidence available was for TE; MRE appeared to be the most accurate method. Imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA in most comparisons, particularly for the identification of F3-4/F4. In the pediatric population, imaging-based NILDA is likely as accurate as in adults.Conclusions:LSM from TE, shear wave elastography, and MRE shows acceptable to outstanding accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis across various liver disease etiologies. Accuracy increased from F2-4 to F3-4 and was the highest for F4. Further research is needed to better standardize the use of imaging-based NILDA, particularly in pediatric liver diseases.

INTRODUCTIONImaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.METHODSThis systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.Study selectionStudies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in imaging-based NILDA systematic reviewaImaging-based with or without blood-based NILDA for fibrosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based test more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 4In children with chronic liver disease (HCV, HIV/HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, biliary atresia, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD, and NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?aThe full list of PICO questions is addressed in the clinical practice guideline.10Abbreviations: α1AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).Data extraction and quality assessmentData extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17TABLE 2 -Pooled diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisStagingNo. studiesCutoff valueabDORPooled sensitivity (95% CI)Pooled specificity (95% CI)HCV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4287 (6.5–7.4) kPa15.875% (70–78)84% (80–88)F0-2 vs. F3-41710 (9.5–10.4) kPa48.887% (83–90)88% (85–90)F0-3 vs. F41713 (12–14) kPa101.588% (82–92)94% (91–96)HCV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-481.2 (1.0–1.3) m/s18.586% (75–92)76% (60–87)F0-2 vs. F3-481.7 (1.6–1.8) m/s41.286% (81–89)87% (81–92)F0-3 vs. F4152 (1.7–2.4) m/s69.789% (85–93)89% (83–93)HCV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-437.3 (7.1–7.5) kPaNA85%–93%86%–91%F0-2 vs. F3-438.9 (8.7–9.1) kPaNA89%–97%84%–98%F0-3 vs. F4410.7 (10.2–11.2) kPaNA88%–100%87%–97%HCV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-423.3 (3.2–3.4) kPaNA78%–89%86%–100%F0-2 vs. F3-423.8 (3.6–4) kPaNA87%–96%76%–100%F0-3 vs. F424.8 (4.6–5) kPaNA88%–100%86%–87%HCV/HIV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-447 (6.5–7.4) kPa13.783% (75–88)74% (67–80)F0-2 vs. F3-4111.5 kPaNA80%91%F0-3 vs. F4214 kPaNA83%–100%84%–93%HBV—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4157 (6.5–7.4) kPa10.969% (62–75)83% (79–87)F0-2 vs. F3-498 (7.6–8.4) kPa31.387% (83–90)83% (76–88)F0-3 vs. F42511 (10–11.9) kPa27.581% (75–86)87% (83–89)HBV—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-441.3 (1.3–1.4) m/s13.276% (44–92)81% (60–92)F0-2 vs. F3-421.6 (1.5–1.6) m/sNA71%–76%86%–90%F0-3 vs. F441.8 (1.7–2.0) m/sNA67%–95%73%–92%HBV—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.1 (6.8–7.2) kPa38.387% (81–92)85% (75–91)F0-2 vs. F3-4410.0–10.2 kPaNA88%–95%76%–96%F0-3 vs. F4511.3 (11.3–11.7) kPa45.589% (81–94)85% (82–88)HBV—MREF0-1 vs. F2-414.1 kPaNA95%95%F0-2 vs. F3-415.5 kPaNA100%100%F0-3 vs. F416.9 kPaNA100%99%HBV/HIV—TEF0-2 vs. F3-417.8 kPaNA62%94%NAFLD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-4177 (6.5–7.4) kPa8.976% (70–82)73% (68–78)F0-2 vs. F3-42210 (9.5–10.4) kPa1782% (76–87)79% (70–85)F0-3 vs. F41013 (11.8–14) kPa69.990% (85–93)89% (79–94)NAFLD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-421.2 (1–1.3) m/sNA85%–90%36%–90%F0-2 vs. F3-441.5 (1.4–1.53) m/s26.570% (58–80)92% (89–94)F0-3 vs. F422 (1.7–2.5) m/sNA75%–90%67%–90%NAFLD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-467.0 to 7.7 kPa20.985% (71–92)79% (61–90)F0-2 vs. F3-458–8.9 kPa32.090% (85–93)79% (62–89)F0-3 vs. F4310 kPaNA83%–92%76%–90%NAFLD—MREF0-1 vs. F2-463.2–3.6 kPa32.678% (65–87)90% (84–94)F0-2 vs. F3-463.7 (3.6–3.9) kPaNA82%–93%90%–95%F0-3 vs. F416.7 kPaNA91%95%ALD—TEF0-1 vs. F2-417.8 kPaNA80%91%F0-2 vs. F3-43Range 11–12 kPaNA76%–87%81%–92%F0-3 vs. F42Range 15–18 kPaNA90%–93%85%–86%ALD—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA85%89%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA82%79%F0-3 vs. F411.9 m/sNA92%82%ALD—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4NANANANANAF0-2 vs. F3-4116.4 kPaNA88%95%F0-3 vs. F4NANANANANAPBC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-418.8 kPaNA67%100%F0-2 vs. F3-4110.7 kPaNA90%93%F0-3 vs. F4116.9 kPaNA93%99%PBC—pSWEF0-1 vs. F2-411.5 m/sNA80%77%F0-2 vs. F3-411.8 m/sNA91%82%F0-3 vs. F412.0 m/sNA100%79%PBC—2D-SWEF0-1 vs. F2-4110.7 kPaNA75%89%F0-2 vs. F3-4112.2 kPaNA90%94%F0-3 vs. F4114.1 kPaNA95%95%PBC—MREF0-1 vs. F2-413.8 kPaNA51%94%F0-2 vs. F3-413.7 kPaNA70%74%F0-3 vs. F414.6 kPaNA60%83%PSC—TEF0-1 vs. F2-428.7 kPaNA81%–89%72%–88%F0-2 vs. F3-429.6 kPaNA90%82%–93%F0-3 vs. F4214.4 kPaNA69%–100%88%–98%aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale used by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only depending on a number of studies and cutoffs included in each study.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NA, not available; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19RESULTSDescription of the evidenceThe search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.PICO 1. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?A summary of results on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults can be found inTable 2.

The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.PICO 2. In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, and F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.TABLE 3 -Comparison between imaging tests for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoff (kPa)apSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5–6.71.2 m/s (pSWE)189, 2102.67 (0.40–17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.61.6 m/s (pSWE)1482.20 (0.28–17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2–13.11.8–2 m/s (pSWE)148,2102.18 (0.56–8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9–7.37.1 kPa (2D-SWE)134,2460.40 (0.16–1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6–11.211.3 kPa (2D-SWE)2460.71 (0.10–5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)2490.71 (0.20–2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.12 m/s (pSWE)392.36 (0.86–6.48)aCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceData supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In adult patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, and ALD) or cholestatic (PBC and PSC) disorders, is imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.TABLE 4 -Comparison of imaging-based against blood-based methods for staging liver fibrosisDiseaseFibrosis stageImaging testab(cutoff)Blood test (cutoff)POR (95% CI)Included studiesHCVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.37–0.67)2.31 (0.39–13.54)92,189,205,258APRI 1.52.05 (0.49–8.58)79APRI 1 (0.75–1.1)1.41 (0.51–3.94)107,259FIB-4 1.058.48(4.88–14.76)92FIB-4 1.45 (1.29–1.47)2.85 (0.84–9.61)189,259FIB-4 2.10.05 (0.001–26.71)205pSWE 1.22 m/sFIB-4 1.45 (1.26–1.53)0.59 (0.21–1.65)189,259APRI 0.670.70 (0.20–2.42)189APRI 0.750.28 (0.02–3.53)259F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.6211.62(1.58–85.47)20,58APRI 1.131.92 (0.56–6.62)107FIB-4 1.452.58(1.50–4.43)20FIB-4 1.874.77 (0.48–47.85)58FIB-4 3.2551.44(22.53–117.48)139pSWE 1.7 (1.61–1.84) m/sFIB-4 3.25 (3.21–3.97)1.47 (0.15–14.33)112,204APRI 0.6211.58(2.37–56.53)136F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 2 (1.73–2.48) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.25–0.75)0.71 (0.12–4.16)136APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.34 (0.04–140.56)204,259FIB-4 40.05 (0.001–29.81)259TE 13 (12–14) kPaAPRI 1 (0.76–1.2)31.99(4.54–225.58)41,92APRI 1.5 (1.27–1.73)2.65 (0.32–22.12)205,259APRI 2 (2–4.3)10.33(3.76–28.37)41,79,189FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–2)7.09(1.94–25.82)20,92FIB-4 2.3124.48(1.87–320.86)205FIB-4 40.11 (0.001–76.52)259FibroSure/FibroTest 0.75 (0.7–0.81)2.98(1.04–8.55)41TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 20.83 (0.002–441)243HCV/HIVF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.54.57(1.81–11.56)42,196APRI 1.11.30 (0.34–5.07)196APRI 1.5 (1.3–1.54)2.38 (0.86–6.60)42,196FIB-4 1.45 (1.21–1.65)3.00 (0.83–10.82)196FibroSure/FibroTest 0.48 (0.4–0.5)0.85 (0.31–2.39)42,196HBVF0-1 vs. F2-4pSWE 1.2 (0.95–1.26) m/sAPRI 0.360.99 (0.140–7.09)222APRI 11.46 (0.17–12.66)222FIB-4 0.633.43 (0.39–29.63)222FIB-4 2.20.80 (0.10–6.56)222TE 7 (6.5–7.4) kPaAPRI 0.5 (0.17–0.67)5.01 (0.98–25.58)248FIB-4 3.25 (2.71–4.9)0.86 (0.10–7.82)237F0-2 vs. F3-4TE 8 (7.6–8.4) kPaFIB-4 1.4516.73(3.76–74.47)131FIB-4 3.257.59 (0.90–63.71)131F0-3 vs. F4pSWE 1.8 (1.74–1.98) m/sAPRI 0.519.95(1.54–258.17)141FIB-4 2.8334.03(3.41–339.16)141TE 11 (10–11.9) kPaAPRI 0.53.03(1.17–7.85)145APRI 0.89.25(4.99–17.13)127APRI 20.65 (0.001–344.43)30,243FIB-4 1.45 (0.8–1.94)3.09(1.65–5.79)127,145NAFLDF0-1 vs. F2-4TE 7 (6.5–7.3) kPaAPRI 0.50.94 (0.27–3.30)153F0-2 vs F3-4pSWE 1.55 (1.4–1.59) m/sAPRI 0.5 (0.43–0.71)2.28(0.81–6.42)113TE 10 (9.5–10.4) kPaAPRI 0.51.46 (0.64–3.37)229APRI 14.35 (0.39–48.46)175APRI 1.51.75 (0.26–11.91)220,229FIB-4 1.3 (0.85–1.3)1.57(1.02–2.43)187,229FIB-4 2.67 (2.09–2.67)1.27 (0.69–2.34)175,187,229FIB-4 3.253.32 (0.24–45.54)12MRE 3.7 (3.6–3.8) kPaAPRI 19.01 (0.95–85.67)63FIB-4 1.36.16 (0.75–50.39)63FIB-4 2.675.98 (0.55–65.38)63ALDF0-2 vs. F3-42D-SWE 16.1 kPaAPRI 125.35(7.68–83.62)219FIB-4 3.2510.35(3.13–34.23)219TE 15 kPaAPRI 116.79(5.56–50.76)219FIB-4 3.256.86(2.26–20.78)219F0-3 vs. F4TE 15 kPaFibroSure/FibroTest 0.755.00(1.54–16.25)224Note: Bold indicates statistical significance.aAlthough TE and 2D-SWE-LSM use a similar kPa scale, this is approximately 3 times larger than the kPa scale use by MRE-LSM.bCutoffs are expressed as mode (range), mode only, or range only.Abbreviations: 2D-SWE, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography; ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; APRI, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index; DOR, diagnostic odds ratio; F, fibrosis; FIB-4, fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; POR, proportional odds ratio; pSWE, point shear wave elastography; TE, transient elastography.Quality of evidenceMeta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias.

In children with chronic liver diseases (HCV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, CFLD, and NAFLD), is imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis?The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s.

The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.DISCUSSIONMain findingsWe identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWe clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in adultsWhen comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.Comparative accuracy of imaging-based versus blood-based NILDA in adultsHead-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295Accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in childrenIn the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.Strengths and limitationsThere was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTAndres Duarte-Rojo consults and received grants from Axcella Health.

Imaging-based methods for noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA)—previously known as noninvasive tests—to stage liver fibrosis (F) in various chronic liver diseases have been widely studied in adults and more recently in children. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained with transient elastography/vibration-controlled transient elastography (TE)1became prominent in the clinical arena in the mid-2000s2,3and was rapidly followed by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)4,5and shear wave elastography (SWE).6,7These imaging-based NILDA modalities quantify the elastic/shear modulus of liver parenchyma (ie, LSM), which constitutes a surrogate of liver fibrosis through the generation of mechanical vibrations in the case of TE and MRE or through acoustic vibrations for SWE (also known as acoustic radiation force impulse or ARFI). The use of ultrasound-based elastography (ie, TE or SWE/ARFI) and MRE have now been disseminated worldwide—largely due to the noninvasive nature of the information they provide,8,9and at least one of these techniques is available at most adult and pediatric hepatology referral centers in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia.

Although the use of imaging-based NILDA is widespread and will likely expand in the future, clinicians must be aware of their potential confounders and limitations. For example, changes in the hepatic parenchyma caused by hepatitis/inflammation, vascular congestion, recent food intake, or obstructive cholestasis may cause alterations in stiffness values that do not correspond with fibrosis. In addition, inflammation resolution in response to liver disease–specific treatment (eg, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis or alcohol cessation) may lead to an immediate drop in LSM, which does not reflect improved fibrosis. Although patients with clinical circumstances affecting the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA were excluded from participation in published studies, the clinician will encounter them in daily practice (see CPG Table 7).10Importantly, the cutoff values used to estimate fibrosis stage can also vary depending on the etiology of liver disease and are different in adults versus children; however, some studies have included mixed etiologies in an effort to simplify the use of imaging-based NILDA.11For this report, we followed an etiology-based approach with the intention of identifying disease-specific threshold values that can better classify fibrosis stages and avoided reports combining histological scores to minimize classification bias.

Cross-sectional NILDA validation for fibrosis requires liver biopsy and rigorous histologic assessment to serve as a standard of reference. Most of the published NILDA literature limited their case definition to those with liver biopsies of adequate size and quality (eg, ≥15 mm and/or ≥10 portal tracts) to maximize the reliability of histological staging. For comparisons on the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, it is best to obtain all tests of interest on the same subject and have the liver histology as the reference standard (recognizing the inherent limitations of liver biopsy). However, comparisons between NILDA methods (ie, blood-based vs. imaging-based) available in the published literature rarely followed this pattern; rather, there are a myriad of published studies claiming one method is better than another based on NILDA-biopsy pairs obtained from different subjects. Furthermore, some studies used an imaging-based method as the reference. These scenarios represent nonideal cross-validation methods. As such, for the sections comparing the accuracy of 2 or more NILDA, we included only studies documenting the availability of all methods under study and a paired liver biopsy from the same individual.

In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the existing literature on the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) for both adults and children with a specific chronic liver disease. We also aimed to understand whether one imaging-based NILDA modality may be more accurate than the others and whether imaging-based NILDA is more accurate than blood-based NILDA10,12for the detection of clinically significant (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with chronic liver diseases.

This systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by the writing group on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guideline Committee. The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).

A comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 21, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases. The full strategy is available in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344.

Studies that answered at least 1 of 4 research or PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions that were determined by the writing group a priori (Table 1) were included.10Furthermore, studies that evaluated imaging tests’ accuracy compared to biopsy in patients with chronic liver diseases for detecting clinically significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were incorporated in this systematic review.

Adult chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD (which included NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Since autoimmune hepatitis studies had been recently covered in a separate guideline,13this condition was omitted to avoid redundancy. Pediatric chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin disease, cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), and NAFLD (also including NASH).

Imaging-based methods of interest were TE, ARFI methods obtained by point SWE (pSWE) and 2-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE), and MRE. Although TE and MRE were consistently expressed in kilopascals (kPa), pSWE and 2D-SWE could be expressed either in meters per second (m/s) or kPa. To maximize data aggregation for the systematic review, we expressed all 2D-SWE results in kPa by transforming m/s to kPa following a standardized conversion table.14Almost all studies using pSWE expressed their results in m/s; however, it was not possible to achieve a uniform pooling of results by transforming kPa to m/s due to variations in manufacturers’ scale calibration. We identified histopathologic fibrosis stages based on METAVIR (meta-analysis of histological data in viral hepatitis) classification or its equivalent of Scheuer, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, Ishak, Ludwig, Brunt, Kleiner, Desmet, and other reported staging systems.10We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 50 patients, mixed etiology of liver disease, a reference standard other than liver histopathology, and unreported cutoff for the imaging test in detecting each of the fibrosis stages. Inclusion of studies with at least 50 patients was determined as an inclusion criterion by the writing group to have a sufficient number of patients to decrease the risk for spectrum bias (ie, have a better representation of the 5 stages of fibrosis), maximize quality of included studies, and for feasibility purposes. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreement between data extractors was resolved by consensus with input from the writing group (guideline panel).

Data extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data regarding baseline characteristics of included studies such as year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, gender, body mass index, staging system, and days between the index test and biopsy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.15

Outcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio [LR+], negative likelihood ratio [LR−], diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], and proportional odds ratio) for the NILDA method being studied in each of the predetermined histopathologic stages of fibrosis (ie, F2-4, F3-4, and F4). The DOR corresponds to the ratio of the positive and negative likelihood ratios summarizing the odds of positivity in those with fibrosis relative to the odds of positivity in those without fibrosis. Whenever 2 NILDA methods were compared against histopathology, proportional odds ratio (also known as relative DOR) was calculated as a measure of the relative accuracy of one test against the other (eg, proportional odds ratio = DOR1 of TE-LSM/DOR2 of TE-SWE), where if the CI crosses 1, then there is no significant difference.16These comparisons were performed using thresholds or cutoff ranges generated during the systematic review after being extracted and summarized (as mode [range], as applicable) from their original publications (Table 2); for blood-based NILDA, multiple cutoff values were considered per test. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp) to synthesize the pool sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−, and DOR with 95% CIs, after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies were needed for each analysis to allow proper estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic andI2values, along with visual inspection of forest plots. If <4 studies were included in the analysis, sensitivity and specificity were reported as ranges. Diagnostic discrimination was classified as poor (0.5–0.69), acceptable (0.7–0.79), excellent (0.8–0.89), or outstanding (≥0.9), depending on the associated accuracy parameter.17

We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to rate certainty in the estimates. The quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies started as high but was rated down for risk of bias or imprecision. A diagnostic estimate is considered imprecise if the lower boundary of a 95% CI of sensitivity or specificity overlaps a value consistent with poor accuracy. For example, a sensitivity estimate with a lower boundary of 95% CI of 57% would be judged as imprecise because it overlapped poor sensitivity below 60%.18,19

The search identified 9447 relevant NILDA studies. A total of 2531 studies were assessed by reviewing the full text, and 240 total studies were finally included (Figure 1). These studies included a total of 61,193 patients. Seventy-seven studies included adult patients with HCV, 6 studies had patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, 75 had patients with HBV, 67 studies had patients with NAFLD, 9 studies had patients with ALD, 6 studies included patients with PBC, 2 studies included patients with PSC, and 1 study included patients with HBV/HIV coinfection (characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344).20–257

Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.

Analyses supporting PICO 1 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that mostly either had a low or moderate risk of bias. The quality of evidence was judged to be high to moderate for sensitivity and specificity estimates except for ALD and PBC/PSC, where the quality was judged to be low, as these estimates were mostly derived from single studies.

There were 7 studies39,134,148,189,210,246,249that compared 2 imaging tests. Studies included patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD, comparing ultrasound elastography methods (TE vs. SWE) in the same population. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the imaging tests based on relative DORs (Table 3). The systematic literature review did not identify comparative studies between TE/SWE and MRE that fit our inclusion criteria.

Data supporting PICO 2 provided severely imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias. The quality of evidence was judged to be very low.

A total of 35 studies12,20,30,41,42,58,63,79,92,107,112,113,127,131,136,139,141,145,153,175,187,189,196,204,205,219,220,222,224,229,237,243,248,258,259compared imaging to blood-based tests (Table 4) in the same patients with histopathology as the standard. In 19 (54%) of these studies, ultrasound-based elastography methods showed improved accuracy in at least 1 stage of fibrosis, when compared to the various blood-based NILDA analyzed.20,41,42,58,79,92,127,131,136,139,141,145,187,189,196,205,219,224,229None of the studies meeting entry criteria showed the superiority of blood tests over imaging tests. Importantly, multiple threshold values were reported for both aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), including some of which were thought to be low for the stage of fibrosis being analyzed (eg, APRI of 1 or FIB-4 of 1.45 for F4). Also, some comparisons were in principle methodologically flawed given differences in thresholds’ determination between analyzed techniques (ie, dual thresholds maximizing sensitivity or specificity vs. single threshold targeting best operational characteristic). NAFLD was the only liver disease for which the benefits of ultrasound-based LSM were less evident and also the only disorder in which MRE was compared to blood-based NILDA and found no differences.

Meta-analysis data supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates and were derived from studies that either had a low or moderate risk of bias. The quality of evidence was judged to be low.

The systematic literature search yielded only 1 pediatric study on the accuracy of pSWE for staging fibrosis preoperatively in 50 infants with biliary atresia.93For significant fibrosis (F2-4), the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 62% using a cutoff value of 1.5 m/s. For advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 74% with a cutoff value of 1.8 m/s. For cirrhosis (F4), the sensitivity was 88% and the specificity 91%, with a cutoff value of 2.1 m/s.

Data supporting PICO 4 were derived from a single study with a low risk of bias. The quality of evidence was judged to be low for sensitivity and specificity estimates due to severe imprecision.

We identified a large number of studies (n = 240) fulfilling our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on data extracted from full-text articles included, we were able to provide estimates of the accuracy of imaging-based NILDA for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) in adults with the most common forms of chronic liver disease, compare the diagnostic performance of imaging NILDA, and compare single imaging methods against blood-based NILDA. In all cases, liver biopsy was used as a reference. Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of studies to perform the NILDA systematic review in the pediatric population.

We clustered results based on chronic liver disease etiology and found that threshold or cutoff values varied across etiologies. Compared to HCV, patients with HBV were found to have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis at lower LSM cutoff values for TE and pSWE (Table 2). The opposite was found for ALD and PBC, where higher US-based elastography LSM cutoffs were needed to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. TE and 2D-SWE-LSM cutoffs for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were the highest for ALD, to the point that values within the advanced fibrosis range for ALD would classify as cirrhosis in other liver disease etiologies. We speculate that active alcohol use was a confounder when assessing LSM,260as it may cause hepatic inflammation, promoting increases in aminotransferases (mainly aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin levels, which have been associated with elevated LSM.261In comparison, alcohol drinking in moderation among patients without ALD has not been found to increase LSM.262Aminotransferase elevation is also known to have an impact on LSM in patients with chronic HCV and HBV and different cutoffs have been recommended for patients with or without significant alanine aminotransferase elevation.263–265Interestingly, the cutoff values identified for cirrhosis with MRE in our analysis on HBV and NAFLD were within the 6–7 kPa range and higher than those we found for HCV,106PBC,176or than those reported in studies with mixed etiology.266,267It is possible that spectrum and selection bias (ie, having a disproportionate representation of tertiary centers including patients with advanced chronic liver disease), including the proportion of patients with active hepatic inflammation,268as well as the type of NILDA equipment used, are responsible for such differences.

Although it is physiologically justified for the various causes of liver disease (ie, HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD, etc) to have a specific LSM cutoff profile on the basis of differences in parenchymal fibrosis deposition/distribution and degree of inflammation, such an approach is debatable, particularly given that it makes the use of NILDA in daily practice more complex. Recent studies analyzing LSM from TE and 2D-SWE from large cohorts that used a dual cutoff approach (ie, low threshold to rule out and high threshold to rule in the condition in question) showed that LSM of 7–8 kPa and 10 kPa are appropriate to rule out advanced fibrosis (ie, F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4), respectively, whereas 12 kPa and 14–15 kPa accurately rule in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, across liver disease etiologies.269,270A recent study in patients with PBC showed similar—albeit slightly lower—dual thresholds for advanced fibrosis at 6.5 kPa (>90% sensitivity/negative predictive value) and 11 kPa (>90% specificity/positive predictive value), respectively.271When aiming to rule out chronic liver disease, a large cohort of healthy individuals found the value of normal LSM with TE to be under 4.5–7 kPa, with cutoff values that varied in response to modifying factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity).272Thus, it remains to be seen whether changes in thresholds respond to the etiology of liver disease or to imaging-based NILDA modifiers such as inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome (see CPG Table 7).10Further studies comparing the effectiveness of using etiology-specific versus across-etiologies, as well as dual versus single cutoff values are needed.

When comparing TE and SWE techniques in head-to-head comparison studies, there did not appear to be clinically meaningful differences in patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.273Of note, the proportion of failed exams per 1 meta-analysis was higher with TE (using M probe) compared with pSWE (ie, 11% vs. 1%),273although the usage of the XL probe in patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance >25 mm markedly reduces technical failure of the former.274A meta-analysis with a head-to-head comparison of TE versus 2D-SWE in 665 patients using liver biopsy as the reference demonstrated excellent accuracy for the 2 methods, with a marginal superiority for 2D-SWE for the diagnosis of F3-4 and F4 (AUROC higher by 0.02–0.08).275A study on 402 patients with HBV also showed improved accuracy for 2D-SWE versus TE (AUROC of 0.87 vs. 0.80, respectively) for the diagnosis of F4,94although other studies have found TE and ARFI-based methods to be similarly accurate, particularly for staging F3-4 or F4 and across various etiologies.81,88,89,246,276–278

There is less available data comparing MRE with TE/SWE methods and either the format of results or significant differences in threshold values across existing publications prevented us from pooling the data. However, MRE has shown superior diagnostic performance over TE in patients with NAFLD in pooled data analysis279of 3 studies109,179,280and in a subanalysis of patients who are obese.281Other studies showed a clear trend for the higher accuracy of MRE when compared to TE for the detection of F3-4 in NAFLD.90,282Regarding the comparison of pSWE versus MRE, there is evidence of better performance for the latter in NAFLD, particularly among patients with obesity.64A meta-analysis in NAFLD disclosed that MRE and SWE had the highest AUROCs for significant and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.283Other studies have found MRE to have improved11,284,285or equivalent accuracy to that of TE286or to 2D-SWE287in mixed etiology cohorts.

Head-to-head comparative studies between blood-based tests and elastography methods in the same patients using biopsy as the reference were available for HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, NAFLD, and ALD. For most comparisons, imaging-based NILDA outperformed blood-based NILDA. Many publications support this concept. In HCV, a meta-analysis comparing TE versus APRI showed significantly better performance for TE for F4 detection only with DORs of 66 and 7, respectively.288These results were supported by another meta-analysis, with better performance for TE versus FIB-4.289For the detection of cirrhosis, mixed results were observed, with some studies showing superior performance of TE versus APRI and FibroSure41,79,92,189while other studies comparing TE or ARFI with blood tests did not.136,189,204,205,259,289For F2-4 staging, the improved accuracy of TE over blood-based NILDA was less clear, and in some studies (including one meta-analysis) blood-based NILDA outperformed or was as accurate as TE.29,289In HBV, TE had overall better performance for diagnosis of F3-4290and for cirrhosis compared to blood tests.116,291Another study with 63 patients with HBV showed higher accuracy of MRE for the diagnosis of F2-4 when compared to APRI and FIB-4, with no differences among SWE, APRI, and FIB-4.292However, a larger study including 402 patients with HBV found SWE to be more accurate than APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of cirrhosis. Although autoimmune hepatitis was covered separately,13we found a systematic review showing that TE outperformed APRI and FIB-4 in accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4.293In NAFLD, despite the fact that we did not observe systematic differences between imaging and blood tests across fibrosis stages, we would like to mention a meta-analysis (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) that showed that MRE and SWE have the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis, compared to blood tests.283Variations in study selection criteria are the likely explanation for the differences observed with the results of a current systematic review. Recent studies in patients with NAFLD showed either equivalent performance for the detection of F3-4 between TE and blood tests (including proprietary blood markers),294or superior diagnostic performance of TE over blood tests,187including FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score.295

In the pediatric population with chronic liver diseases, imaging-based NILDA tests showed both different disease-specific and fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population. This is particularly true for infants with biliary atresia, in whom pSWE showed very good to excellent accuracy (AUROC: 0.82–0.92) for all fibrosis stages while using higher cutoff values than those used for adult populations, likely driven by impaired biliary outflow.93Authors found 5 other studies on the pediatric population through a careful search of published literature, which were missed by our database search strategy. Four of them evaluated the utility of TE, 2D-SWE, and MRE to detect and stage liver fibrosis in children or adolescents with NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Two cohorts tested the accuracy of TE. The first one included 52 patients and found an AUROC of 1.0 for the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 10.2 kPa, whereas the second one, with 67 patients, showed the same accuracy for significant fibrosis (F2-4) at a cutoff value of 8.6 kPa.296,297In 68 children with NAFLD and steatohepatitis, 2D-SWE showed an AUROC of 0.97 for significant fibrosis (F2-4), with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96% based on a cutoff of 6.7 kPa.298Using automated readings of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD, Schwimmer et al299reported an AUROC of 0.89 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a low sensitivity of 33% but a high specificity of 91% using a cutoff of 3.3 kPa. The fifth study assessed the accuracy of TE in 50 children with HCV and reported an AUROC of 0.87 for significant fibrosis (F2-4) and 0.80 for advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The authors did not provide data for cutoffs and cited small sample sizes as the reasons for not providing sensitivity or specificity.300

There are several biopsy-validated studies in children with sample sizes <50 or just outside the publication date criteria that merit mention. Regarding biliary atresia, in 47 infants before Kasai portoenterostomy, TE demonstrated very good detection of F3-4 using a cutoff of 9.6 kPa and excellent discrimination of F4 with a cutoff of 18.1 kPa.301In a study of 39 children after Kasai, TE again demonstrated good prediction of F4, but with a much higher threshold of 23.8 kPa.302Recognizing that older children sustain a prolonged liver injury in a neonatal disease such as biliary atresia, the AUROC to detect F4 unsurprisingly increased with age. Lastly, in a study of 24 children after Kasai, 2D-SWE demonstrated only fair discrimination of significant fibrosis (F2-4) with a cutoff of 9.4 KPa but good discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), with a cutoff of 24.4 kPa for F4.303These 3 studies highlight the age and biological differences in the thresholds needed for ultrasound-based elastography to detect F4 in biliary atresia before and after Kasai portoenterostomy. In one of the few biopsy-validated imaging-based NILDA studies in children with CFLD, TE demonstrated excellent detection (AUROC of 0.89) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 8.7 kPa304in 22 patients. Lastly, in a series of 30 children with HCV, TE was found to be a good predictor (AUROC: 0.82) of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) using a cutoff of 9.5 kPa and a presumably perfect predictor (AUROC: 1.0) of cirrhosis (F4) using a cutoff of 12.5 kPa.305Notably, among children, imaging-based NILDA thresholds for hepatocellular diseases such as HCV and NAFLD seem quite different and often much lower than those with biliary atresia, a highly cholestatic liver disease. The assessment of CFLD, a condition recognized for hepatobiliary and vasculopathic phenotypes, also has disease-specific thresholds. However, irrespective of threshold differences, the overall accuracy of imaging-based NILDA in the pediatric population seems to be comparable to that of adults.

While there is a high correlation between imaging-based NILDA platforms with biopsy-proven fibrosis in children, it is not possible to recommend a single test over another to assess liver fibrosis. This is due to the limited evidence and the lack of comparative studies of imaging-based NILDA against histopathology in children with chronic liver diseases. Although TE is the most studied imaging modality, MRE offers an attractive (near) whole liver assessment; however, a specific barrier in pediatric cases is the lack of child cooperation. In light of emerging data that more than 1 in 5 children are morbidly obese and NAFLD will soon become the prime indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable method for quantifying fibrosis across the whole spectrum (ie, F1 to F4) in children without the need for sedation is a major priority.

There was heterogeneity regarding the size of liver biopsy specimens and the number of portal tracts, which were not reported in all publications; the timing between studied NILDA and reference liver biopsy also varied (see Supplemental Table S1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I344). Within each imaging-based NILDA, there was wide variability in the cutoffs used to define fibrosis stages, which made it difficult to combine studies when analyzing imaging-NILDA comparisons. In fact, multiple studies had to be eliminated due to reporting noncompatible thresholds. Similarly, various ARFI-based and MRE techniques from different manufacturers were assumed to be equivalent and combined for the purpose of summarizing evidence, which may lead to inconsistency in the data. Apart from inherent differences across devices, definitions of elastography acquisition failure and reliability for SWE and MRE were not reported in many studies and not accounted for when pooling results. In contrast, TE results across devices (eg, Fibroscan 502 vs. 530) are equivalent,306and most of the pooled studies in our systematic review adhered to standard quality reporting parameters (ie, at least 60% valid determinations, with interquartile range/median <30%).

Unlike other systematic reviews that have claimed the superiority of one NILDA over other(s),281,283,288,293we decided to limit our analysis to studies comparing 2 or more methods performed on the same individual against liver biopsy as a reference. This approach limited the number of studies to analyze, but the Practice Guidelines Committee and writing group weighed this to be the most appropriate method. Our results may contradict results from other systematic reviews and meta-analyses; however, inclusion/exclusion criteria may differ, leading to biases and differences in results. We were not able to include an emerging body of literature using unique imaging-based cutoff values across mixed etiology populations,269a simplified approach that would facilitate LSM implementation in clinical practice.307–310Of note, some of these studies included more than 1 ultrasound-based modality or their comparison against MRE. Finally, our systematic review could not address the effect of active versus inactive disease (eg, treated HBV/HCV, ongoing alcohol use in ALD) as a confounder, as this was not systematically reported across publications.

In conclusion, our systematic review identified etiology-specific LSM threshold values from studies including histopathology as the reference and a minimum of 50 patients. LSM from TE, SWE, and MRE showed acceptable to excellent accuracy for the detection of liver fibrosis, with increasing accuracy from clinically significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and highest for the identification of cirrhosis across examined etiologies. The thresholds herein reported for staging fibrosis can be applied in clinical practice with some degree of confidence, particularly for patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD and when using TE and pSWE techniques, for which the largest body of evidence exists. Although we were not able to confirm or refute the improved accuracy of one LSM method to the others, MRE showed the highest sensitivity and specificity despite the small number of studies included. Similarly, we were not able to consistently show better accuracy of imaging-based NILDA over blood-based NILDA across all stages and all liver disease etiologies. However, our results and more recent evidence described above suggest that imaging-based NILDA could be more accurate than blood-based NILDA, particularly for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.
