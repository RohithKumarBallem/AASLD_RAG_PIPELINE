HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test. This study reviewed noninvasive methods, like blood tests and imaging, to predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Nine studies with 2492 patients were analyzed, showing imaging tests like transient elastography and shear wave elastography had better accuracy than blood tests, although there was substantial variation in their accuracy. However, there was significant variability in results and cutoff values, making it difficult to set definitive standards for CSPH detection. Imaging tests are promising, but more research is needed to refine their use in clinical settings.Text is machine generated and may contain inaccuracies.FAQINTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

      "AbstractPlain Language SummaryBackground and Aims:Portal hypertension is a serious complication of cirrhosis, which leads to life-threatening complications. HVPG, a surrogate of portal pressure, is the reference standard test to assess the severity of portal hypertension. However, since HVPG is limited by its invasiveness and availability, noninvasive liver disease assessments to assess portal pressure, especially clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), are needed.Approach and Results:We conducted a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE(R) Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022. We included only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies, which compared noninvasive tests (blood and/or imaging) to HVPG for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined as HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg) in patients with chronic liver disease. Outcomes included measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Additionally, a narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided. Nine studies with 2492 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity with regard to liver disease studied and cutoff values used to detect CSPH. Blood-based tests, including aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (56% sensitivity and 68% specificity) and FIB-4 (54% sensitivity and 73% specificity) had low accuracy measures. Imaging-based tests (transient elastography and shear wave elastography detection of liver stiffness measurement [LSM]) had better accuracy but also had substantial variation; at 15 kPa, TE sensitivity was 90%–96% and specificity was 48%–50%, while at 25 kPa, its sensitivity and specificity were 57%–85% and 82%–93%, respectively. The narrative review suggested that imaging-based tests are the best available noninvasive liver disease assessment to detect CSPH; CSPH is highly unlikely to be present at an LSM ≤15 kPa and likely to be present at an LSM ≥25 kPa.Conclusions:While imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment appeared to have higher accuracy than blood-based tests to detect CSPH, only 9 studies fit the a priori established inclusion criteria for the systematic review. In addition, there was substantial study heterogeneity and variation in cutoffs for LSM to detect CSPH, limiting the ability to establish definitive cutoffs to detect CSPH.Plain Language SummaryPortal hypertension is a severe complication of cirrhosis, traditionally assessed by the invasive HVPG test.

      "INTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDon C.

      "INTRODUCTIONPortal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided.METHODSThe systematic review was performed following an a priori protocol developed by a clinical practice guideline writing group designated by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). The reporting of this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statements (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).Search strategyA comprehensive search of several databases from each database’s inception to April 22, 2022, in any language was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of noninvasive assessment of liver diseases (the strategy used is available in the Appendix,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I347).Study selectionWe included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22TABLE 1 -PICO questions addressed in the systematic reviewQuestion 1In adult patients with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (blood and/or imaging) for predicting the degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?Question 2In children with chronic liver diseases, what is the diagnostic performance of noninvasive methods (serum and/or imaging) for predicting degree of portal hypertension (based on HVPG)?This systematic review is part of 3 systematic reviews supporting AASLD guidelines about (NILDA) for chronic liver diseases.17,18Given the large scope of the project, it was decided a priori to narrow the scope to disease-specific studies for all of the reviews—to enhance the precision and for feasibility purposes. Therefore, for all the reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥50 patients in single liver disease etiologies which compared noninvasive tests (ie, blood and/or imaging), a gold standard (here, HVPG) are included.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with a sample size of <50 patients, (2) those who examined mixed etiologies of liver disease, (3) those who used a reference standard other than HVPG (ie, such as esophageal varices), and (4) those with unreported cutoffs for the blood-based or imaging-based tests. Studies that included mixed etiologies of liver disease in which data were provided for unique liver diseases (with a sample size ≥50) were included. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the studies for potential eligibility. The full articles of selected studies were independently reviewed by both independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Data extraction and quality assessmentData extracted by 2 independent reviewers included the year of publication, country of the study, setting, main institution, study period, specific disease, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, age group, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic test accuracy. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies.23Outcome measures and analysisOutcomes corresponded to measures of diagnostic test accuracy [sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and AUROC]. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to synthesize and pool sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic OR with 95% CIs after extracting the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates across included studies. A minimum of 4 studies are needed for each analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q-statistic and I-squared values. If <4 studies are included for the analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were reported as ranges. We used a bivariate regression model to pool data across studies accounting for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity.Grading the quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to rate certainty in the estimates.24Quality of evidence derived from diagnostic studies was considered to be high but could be rated down for the risk of bias or imprecision (based upon whether the 95% CI for sensitivity or specificity crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.75).25,26Narrative reviewIt is important to point out that many studies for the narrative review were obtained through the same search as for the systematic review. In addition, studies identified by the writing group were included.RESULTSSystematic reviewDescription of the evidenceThe literature search identified a total of 9447 studies (Figure 1). Nine studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria27–35(Table 2and3). All included studies examined only adult patients addressing PICO 1; none studied pediatric populations, and thus, PICO question 2, as stated, was not addressed. Combined, the 9 studies included a total of 2492 patients. Two studies were conducted in each Italy and Austria, while 1 study was in each South Korea, Spain, the United States and China, and one study was international. All included studies examined only adult patients. Four studies had a high risk of bias, one study had a moderate risk of bias, and 4 had a low risk of bias (Table 4). NILDAs examined in these studies are reviewed in the following sections.FIGURE 1:Flowchart of included studies in the systematic review.TABLE 2 -Characteristics of included studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesCountry, setting, main institution(s), study periodSpecific diseaseInclusion/exclusion criteriaSample sizeAge (mean, y)Sex (proportion women) (%)Mean BMIHVPG-defined portal HTN (% of total patients)InterventionBanini et al35Unites States, single center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 10/2016 to 05/2020NAFLDAdult patients with CLD who were referred for TJLB and had FIB-4 and VCTEExclusion criteria: a history of liver transplantation, pregnancy, CHF, or severe valvular disease1975558NRCSPH: HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (11%)FIB-4, VCTECho et al30Korea, Wonju SeveranceChristian Hospital, 01/2009 to 12/2013Alcohol-associated cirrhosisPatients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with baseline HVPG and LSM were included.

Throughout the document, the term LSM when used alone indicates VCTE-LSM (also TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. As TE-LSM cutoffs increased, the sensitivity of TE-LSM for the detection of CSPH decreased while specificity increased.27–35In patients with HCV viremia, TE-LSM had a 94% (95% CI: 85%–98%) sensitivity and 81% (95% CI: 50%–95%) specificity using cutoff values of 12.4–14.3 kPa for the detection of CSPH (4 studies). When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–18.8 kPa, TE-LSM sensitivity was 92%–100%, and specificity was 48%–71% (3 studies). Using TE-LSM cutoff values of 23 kPa and higher, TE-LSM sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 47%–61%), with specificity of 95% (95% CI: 90%–98%) (4 studies) (Table 3).In patients with ALD, with TE-LSM cutoff values of 13.6–15 kPa, sensitivity was 96%–97% and specificity 32%–50% for the detection of CSPH. TE-LSM cutoff values of 19–21.8 kPa had a sensitivity of 72%–89% and a specificity of 70%–73%,30while a cutoff value of 25 kPa had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82%.In patients with NAFLD, TE-LSM had a 93% sensitivity and a 38% specificity at a cutoff value of 13.6 kPa34for the detection of CSPH. When using TE-LSM cutoff values of 15–16.8 kPa in 2 studies,34,35TE sensitivity was 78%–90% and specificity of was 50%–55%. With TE-LSM cutoff values of 21.3–25 kPa, TE-LSM had a sensitivity of 59%–67% and a specificity of 70%–89%.34,35Acoustic radiation force impulse LSMIn patients with HBV and cirrhosis (unknown virological status), ARFI had 79% sensitivity and 56% specificity using a cutoff value of 1.79 m/s for the detection of CSPH.33For detection of HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, using an ARFI cutoff value of 1.9 m/s, ARFI sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 65%, respectively.33Spleen stiffness measurementIn patients with chronic HCV viremia, one study examined SSM to predict CSPH. Sensitivity was 99% and specificity was 74% when using cutoff value of <40 kPa.29When using a cutoff of >52.8 kPa, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 97%.Liver stiffness–spleen diameter to platelet ratio scoreThe combination of the 3 noninvasive measurements—LSM, spleen diameter (in millimeters), and platelet count—have been developed to calculate the spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) using the following formula: LSM × spleen diameter/platelets.36One study examined LSPS and HVPG in patients with HCV viremia29and found that using a 0.927 kPa cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH were 99% and 54%, respectively. When using a cutoff value of 3.75 kPa, sensitivity was 52%, and specificity was 97%. Another study examined LSPS to detect CSPH in ALD30using a cutoff value of 1.7 kPa, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 73%.Platelet/spleen ratioOne study examined the ability of platelet count (platelet number/mcL or mm3) to spleen diameter (in millimeters) ratio to predict CSPH in patients with HCV viremia. Sensitivity was 99%, and specificity was 14% when using cutoff ratio value of 2340.29When using a cutoff of 695, sensitivity was 48%, while specificity was 97%. Another study compared the prediction of CSPH using platelet to spleen ratio in patients with ALD and found an intermediate sensitivity of 54% with a specificity of 78%.30Systematic review summaryThe data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows.NARRATIVE REVIEWDiscussionThrombocytopeniaCirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.Direct and indirect blood-based NILDASeveral direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44Imaging-based NILDAVibration-controlled liver elastographyAs mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.Magnetic resonance elastographyRigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.Spleen elastographyPortal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.Combination NILDAIn a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertensionIn multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888).SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCHNILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states.Research is needed on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations.Definitions of the performance and threshold of blood and imaging-based NILDA for CSPH in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease.Studies using combination techniques—including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required.Further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for the incorporation of demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of portal hypertension, specific liver diseases, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed. Study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed.Further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required.Cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.Novel noninvasive techniques for the assessment of CSPH are needed.In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation."

      "Portal hypertension is a devastating complication of the most advanced form of hepatic fibrosis, namely cirrhosis. Severe portal hypertension leads to the development of varices, ascites, and HE. Other negative outcomes associated with the most severe forms of portal hypertension include acute kidney injury, variceal bleeding, and a high surgical and overall mortality risk. As such, assessment of the severity (ie, the level of increased portal pressure) of portal hypertension is of critical clinical importance.",
      "The pathogenesis of portal hypertension is complex but is informed by the hydraulic equivalent of Ohm law, where “Pressure=Resistance × Flow.” In virtually all forms of intrahepatic liver disease, portal pressure is believed to increase progressively over time as a result of cellular and molecular derangement in the intrahepatic sinusoids, followed by increases in blood flow as the disease progresses. The level of increased intrahepatic resistance varies with specific forms of liver disease and may occur at presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal levels. Cellular factors (in particular activated hepatic stellate cells, which can alter sinusoidal blood flow after their activation), sinusoidal fibrosis, larger bands of fibrosis, regenerative nodules, intrahepatic shunts, and hepatocyte swelling are important in increasing intrahepatic resistance to blood flow.1–7It has been proposed that both fixed (ie, fibrosis and regenerative nodules) and adaptable elements (ie, contraction of hepatic stellate cells) contribute to the increased intrahepatic resistance typical of portal hypertension.8Moreover, regulable elements, including the cellular compartment and fibrosis reversal, represent important potential targets for therapeutic intervention.1,2,6,7,9",
      "Portal pressure appears to increase in proportion to the degree of fibrosis. There is controversy about this assumption, however, given the fact that fibrosis probably does not progress linearly. Nonetheless, substantial investigation of the relationship between fibrosis and portal hypertension has been undertaken. An important limitation in the assessment of noninvasive measures of portal hypertension is that the reference standard for the assessment of portal pressure—HVPG—is not only uncommonly measured but also requires considerable expertise and is subject to a variety of technical limitations.7Portal hypertension is considered to be present at an HVPG above 5 mm Hg, and a level ≥10 mm Hg is considered clinically important (and termed “clinically significant portal hypertension” or CSPH).10Notably, the threshold of ≥10 mm Hg has been most frequently used as the comparator threshold for most studies of noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA).",
      "Abundant data suggest that HVPG predicts outcome.11,12For example, in patents with compensated cirrhosis, HVPG predicts the risk of developing portal hypertension–related complications,13and patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HVPG ≥10 mm Hg have a higher risk of clinical decompensation while an HVPG of ≥16 mm Hg is strongly associated with death.14Further, in compensated cirrhosis, an HVPG reduction of 10% or more after therapy is associated with a decreased risk of first variceal hemorrhage.15,16Thus, HVPG is considered the single best predictor of outcome available to clinicians. Since the clinical use of HVPG measurement is limited by its invasiveness and technical limitations, noninvasive methods to predict the presence of elevated portal pressure would be ideal in clinical practice.",
      "NILDAs include blood-based and imaging-based tests.17,18Since NILDAs appear to be most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis), and since portal hypertension is associated with more severe fibrosis, including cirrhosis, it follows that NILDA would be expected to readily detect portal hypertension or CSPH. However, this positive relationship is likely to be offset by variability in the development of portal hypertension.",
      "Despite the attractiveness of NILDA to assess portal pressure, the field is limited by several important factors. First, the number of studies that have assessed noninvasive measures of portal hypertension and portal pressure measured by the reference standard—HPVG—is limited. Second, most studies have examined noninvasive tests in the context of their ability to detect large esophageal varices, which are themselves an imprecise measure of portal hypertension, given the wide array of factors that appear to be necessary for the development of varices. This is problematic because while the evidence suggests that esophageal varices develop only after HVPG is elevated (typically above 10–12 mm Hg), not all patients with portal hypertension develop esophageal varices, and further, assessments of esophageal varix size are highly subjective. Finally, much of the currently available data have been derived in patients with HCV, including in a mix of viremic-eradicated and virus-eradicated patients, and it is not entirely clear whether portal hypertension in this disease is the same as in other forms of liver disease.",
      "The objective of this systematic and narrative review is to highlight current literature that informs the use of NILDA in the assessment of the severity of portal hypertension, using HVPG as a comparator. Of note, this review intentionally did not attempt to assess NILDA for the prediction of esophageal varices. Further details surrounding the management of portal hypertension and varices are discussed elsewhere.19Additionally, given the strict entry criteria for the systematic review (and the necessary exclusion of studies that included smaller numbers of patients in each liver disease category), an additional narrative review of studies not eligible for the systematic review is also provided."

      "We included studies that answered at least 1 of 2 research questions that were determined a priori by the clinical practice guideline writing group (Table 1). This included studies that evaluated NILDA (blood-based or imaging-based) test accuracy, specifically compared to HVPG in patients with chronic liver diseases, to address 2 clinically focused questions in the “patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth, PICO format. Chronic liver diseases were identified as HCV, HCV with HIV infection (HCV/HIV), HCV after liver transplantation, HBV infection, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; specific liver disease diagnoses are described in each original study, and typically were based on commonly accepted definitions. We recognize that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. While this is an important change that will impact the future of the study of this entity, all data used to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature, which used the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Imaging-based methods of interest for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were transient elastography (TE), the acoustical radiofrequency imaging (ARFI) methods obtained by point shear wave elastography (SWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Throughout the document, the term “LSM” when used alone indicates vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE-LSM; also known as TE-LSM) unless otherwise stated. Blood-based tests included platelet count, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio,20aspartate-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),21and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index.22",

      "Systematic review summary",
      "The data from the formal systematic review indicate that NILDA have modest, at best, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CSPH—whether for blood-based tests, imaging-based tests, or combinations of tests. The small number of studies that could be included in this analysis limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. A further important conclusion of these studies is that as cutoffs vary, sensitivity and specificity vary (Table 3); also noteworthy is that studies have been performed in patients with a variety of etiologies of liver diseases, and it is not clear that cutoffs are the same for different diseases. The limitations in the literature around the use of NILDA for the assessment of CSPH are similar to those found with the use of NILDA for the prediction of fibrosis.17,18,37–39",
      "The best available NILDA for the assessment of CSPH appears to be LSM (typically TE-LSM) (Table 3). Unfortunately, data supporting the use of blood-based NILDA are so limited that these tests cannot be recommended for assessing CSPH. Based on existing data, the writing group concluded that for ALD, HCV (viremic), and NASH, LSM values of <15 kPa rule out CSPH in most patients and that LSM values of >25 kPa rule in CSPH. Based on other data not included in the formal analysis, these LSM values may be combined with platelet counts to enhance the noninvasive assessment of CSPH (see below and the study by Sterling et al37). Currently, though data are emerging, the available data do not allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the use of NIDLA for assessment of CSPH in patients in which the primary liver disease has been arrested or effectively treated.",
      "It is important to point out that many studies did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this systematic review; studies with mixed etiologies of liver disease and sample sizes of less than 50 patients were excluded. Additionally, there was only one study in the pediatric population. Finally, we recognize that the field is rapidly expanding; since the data retrieval for the formal systematic review included studies prior to April 2022, more recent studies were omitted. For this reason, and because the analysis excluded many other studies that provide additional information focused on this topic, a narrative review of available literature in adult populations follows."

      "Thrombocytopenia",
      "Cirrhosis with portal hypertension is well known to cause splenomegaly,40which in turn causes platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia. In a study of 213 patients with compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices who were followed for approximately 9 years until the development of varices or variceal bleeding or completion of the study, there was a moderate correlation between HVPG and platelets at baseline (Spearman correlation ofr=−0.44).41This correlation remained present during the study at 1 and 5 years in both alcohol-mediated and nonalcohol-mediated liver diseases. Although a lower platelet count was significantly associated with increased HVPG, only 106/136 patients with CSPH had a platelet count of <100,000/mcL (sensitivity of 78% for detection of CSPH), and a platelet count of >100,000/mcL had specificity for exclusion of CSPH of <50%.41Of note, platelet counts declined over time in patients who developed esophageal varices, consistent with the concept that platelets decline as portal hypertension worsens. It is possible that platelet counts in combination with other measures of fibrosis may be more accurate in estimating portal hypertension. In aggregate, although thrombocytopenia is clearly a consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, it alone is an inadequate marker for CSPH.",
      "Direct and indirect blood-based NILDA",
      "Several direct and indirect blood-based NILDA have been proposed to predict CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mm Hg) or severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mm Hg). For example, in a study of 92 patients with various etiologies of cirrhosis that studied FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France, also Fibrosure in the United States),42values were 0.73 versus 0.87 for those with HVPG <12 mm Hg or HVPG ≥12 mm Hg, respectively; the AUROC for the diagnosis of severe portal hypertension was 0.79, which was similar to platelets and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. In a small study of 30 patients (including 21 with portal hypertension), the ELF score correlated significantly with HVPG (PearsonR=0.758,p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with HVPG in the subgroup of patients with CSPH.43In a study of 219 patients with compensated (n=88) and decompensated (n=131) ALD cirrhosis, the AUROC of APRI and FIB-4 for the detection of CSPH were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively—substantially lower than for LSM, which was 0.85.30Finally, in a study of patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis and cirrhosis, the ELF score, FibroTest/FibroSure, FIB-4, and APRI also modest correlation with HVPG.44",
      "Imaging-based NILDA",
      "Vibration-controlled liver elastography",
      "As mentioned above, since fibrosis is, in theory, reflective of portal hypertension, it follows that LSM (note, LSM refers to VCTE-LSM). Vibration-controlled TE has been used most often to measure liver stiffness and detect CSPH (in the setting of known HVPG)27,29–35,45–65and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 7. An early study of HVPG and LSM in 61 consecutive patients with viremic HCV-related chronic liver disease demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between LSM and HVPG levels (r=0.81,p<0.0001).27LSM cutoff values of 13.6 and 17.6 kPa had a sensitivity of 97% and 94% for an HVPG ≥10 and ≥12 mm Hg, respectively. In patients with cirrhosis, LSM also positively correlated with the presence of esophageal varices, although no correlation between LSM and esophageal variceal size was detected. Studies of patients with liver disease other than HCV have also demonstrated relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH at LSM levels in the 20 kPa range. Of note, LSM cutoffs chosen by authors for the detection of CSPH are higher in ALD than in HCV, despite the fact that the range of HVPGs in the various clinical cohorts is similar. This highlights potential confounding by including patients with active hepatocyte injury and inflammation, which appears to increase LSM regardless of the severity of fibrosis and portal hypertension.",
      "In one metanalysis that included 11 studies and 1451 patients with cirrhosis or CLD examining the diagnostic performance of TE for CSPH (in patients with known HVPG levels), there was a high correlation between LSM and HVPG (the summary correlation coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82).66In a separate bivariate random effects model to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of TE to diagnose CSPH, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 88% (95% CI: 76–94%) and 85% (95% CI: 77%–91%), respectively; the AUROC was 0.9. Among the 11 included studies, 5 (422 patients) used LSM cutoff values of 21–25 kPa, while 5 other studies (848 patients) used LSM cutoffs from 13.6 to 18 kPa. In the subgroup using the lower cutoff value (13.6–18 kPa), the summary sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%–95.7%) with a specificity of 81%; (95% CI: 70%–89%) compared to the subgroup using the higher cutoff (21–25 kPa), which had a summary sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 52%–85%) and specificity 91% (95% CI: 82%–96%).",
      "In a second meta-analysis that included 328 patients with cirrhosis from 5 different studies (89 with compensated cirrhosis and 237 with decompensated cirrhosis), 2D-SWE was examined in patients with HVPG measurement.67The median 2D-SWE LSM was significantly higher for patients with CSPH [32 kPa, p25–p75 (22–42)] compared to patients without CSPH [14 kPa, p25–p75; (13–23)p<0.001]. An optimal cutoff to rule out CSPH was found to be 14 kPa (in order to maximize sensitivity to 90%). At this cutoff, the summary ROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity were 0.88 (0.85–0.91), 91% (86%–94%), and 37% (18%–61%), respectively. Of the 45 patients with 2D-SWE below 14 kPa, 27 (60%) were false negatives, with 9 having HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. Of note, 21 (78%) of these 27 patients were decompensated at baseline. To optimize specificity, an optimal cutoff to rule in CSPH was 32.0 kPa, providing a summary AUROC, summary sensitivity, and summary specificity of 0.83 (0.79–0.86), 47% (36%–60%), and 89% (74%–96%), respectively. Of the 150 patients with 2D-SWE ≥32 kPa, 5 (3%) were false positives, with HVPG <10 mm Hg.",
      "How LSM compares to blood-based NILDA for the detection of CSPH is not entirely clear. Few head-to-head studies have both blood-based and imaging NILDA simultaneously. In a small study of patients with various causes of liver disease, MRE-based LSM was similar to ELF in terms of correlation between the 2 NILDA.43In a study of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, at cutoff values optimized as the value with the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity, LSM had an AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of CSPH of 0.85, 72%, and 70% compared to 0.64, 56%, and 68% for APRI, and 0.65, 54%, and 73% for FIB-4, respectively.30",
      "There are caveats regarding the use of LSM to assess CSPH. First, there are likely differences in the ability of LSM to detect CSPH in different diseases. For example, in 1 study of 836 patients with advanced chronic liver disease, including many reported in other studies, as well as a new cohort of 220 patients with NASH,34it was found that an LSM cutoff ≥25 kPa ruled in CSPH with a PPV ≥90% in ALD, HBV (treatment status not stated), HCV (viremic), and nonobese patients with NASH, while in comparison, in obese patients with NASH, the PPV was only 63%.",
      "Another issue concerning the use of LSM to assess CSPH is that although LSM appears to be reasonably accurate at HVPG values up to 10 mm Hg (the CSPH threshold), it is not as accurate in severe portal hypertension—at values above 12 mm Hg.27,60This point is consistent with the concept that the pathogenesis of portal hypertension at lower portal pressures is most likely to be more directly linked to factors within the liver, such as fibrosis, while at higher portal pressures (above 12 mm Hg), the degree of portal hypertension is often highly dependent on extrahepatic components, such as the hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilatation, which cannot be accounted for by LSM. It is also important to recognize that because current medical therapies (ie, nonselective beta-blockers) reduce portal pressure by decreasing mesenteric blood flow and not by reducing fibrosis, LSM is unlikely to be useful in monitoring the hemodynamic response to drug therapy.",
      "Magnetic resonance elastography",
      "Rigorous studies examining MRE specifically in the setting of portal hypertension are currently limited, and moreover, they have typically not used HVPG as the reference standard (as have many TE-based studies). A systematic review evaluating LSM (14 studies) and/or SSM (8 studies) measured by MRE using indirect assessments of portal hypertension (ie, ascites and esophageal varices) reported that the summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC values for LSM on MRE were 83% (95% CI: 72%–90%), 80% (95% CI: 70%–88%), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91), respectively, at a mean cutoff value of 5.1 kPa.68This review, however, is limited by extensive heterogeneity of the populations as well as the reference standards used (ie, complications of portal hypertension—varices and ascites, rather than HVPG). In a study that examined HPVG as a reference standard in 36 adult patients with cirrhosis, at a cutoff of 4.5 kPa, the sensitivity for MRE to detect an HVPG ≥12 mm Hg was 65% with a specificity of 80% and an AUROC of 0.81.69Thus, while there is likely promise in the use of MRE-LSM for the prediction of CSPH, much more study is required.",
      "Spleen elastography",
      "Portal hypertension leads to splenomegaly, and in this setting, the spleen undergoes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and fibrogenesis.70These abnormalities lead to splenomegaly, and additionally, the spleen becomes stiff. For this reason, SSM is an especially attractive approach to assess the severity of portal hypertension. A number of studies have examined SSM in portal hypertension29,45,49,51,52,55,56,71–73and and see also the guideline by Sterling et al37including Table 8. In 2 studies, each with 60 patients with cirrhosis comparing LSM and SSM, the correlation between HVPG and stiffness revealed that SSM correlated better with HVPG than LSM (Rvalues 0.85 vs. 0.51,71and (0.88 vs. 0.61),72suggesting that SSM is more accurate than LSM.",
      "Another study that examined whether LSM or SSM could predict the decrease in HVPG after TIPS demonstrated in 31 patients that the mean decrease in HVPG after TIPS was 63%.74LSM and SSM decreased significantly between baseline and 6 weeks after TIPS (LSM: 3.15–2.67 m/s, and SSM: 3.79–2.91 m/s). HVPG decreased to ≤10 mm Hg in 61%. The accuracy of LSM and SSM for the prediction of CSPH was high; for LSM with a cutoff of 3.60 m/s, the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.88, 80%, 90%, and 57%, respectively. For SSM, at a cutoff of 4.09 m/s, these values were 0.90, 80%, 96%, and 80%, respectively. These data further suggest that SSM is superior to LSM as a noninvasive surveillance tool for evaluating patients with CSPH in the setting of TIPS, and raise the possibility that dynamic extrahepatic blood flow changes and perhaps remodeling associated with portal hypertension can be monitored noninvasively.",
      "Although some data suggest that SSM may be superior to LSM for the detection of CSPH, not all studies have come to this conclusion. In a study of 100 consecutive patients with HCV (viremic) cirrhosis in whom LSM, SSM, HVPG, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and liver biopsy were all performed, LSM and SSM had similar performance characteristics at specified cutoff values (for the spleen, 40 kPa) for the detection of CSPH.29In a meta-analysis that included 584 patients and 4 different US-elastography techniques, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CSPH was 0.88 and 0.84 at the SSM cutoff proposed in each individual study, respectively, and the AUROC for the detection of CSPH was 0.92.73In aggregate, available data suggest that SSM is likely similar in accuracy as LSM for assessment for CSPH.",
      "Notwithstanding the attractiveness of TE-SSM for the assessment of portal hypertension, it has not gained widespread utility as a noninvasive assessment tool, largely because of technical limitations. There are higher failure rates for TE-SSM than other imaging-based elastography techniques.75–79The higher TE-SSM failure rate is felt to be in part to be due to difficulty in localizing the spleen. Operator experience is also important; in one study, TE-SSM failures decreased from 8%–12% to 0%–2% after operators gained experience over 18–24 months.80Of note, a new TE probe made for SSM (SSM: 100 Hz) may allow for improved performance,81and the use of SWE techniques may enhance the visualization rate of the spleen. Another issue with the use of SSM is that thresholds used to predict CSPH has been extremely high (eg, 75 kPa in some studies). SSM may also be affected by the etiology of cirrhosis; for example, patients with ALD may have higher SSM values compared to other causes of cirrhosis. Perhaps the most problematic issue surrounding SSM for the estimation of CSPH is that the data reported include heterogeneous populations. For example, studies reporting accuracy measures frequently include only those patients with interpretable data, leading to selection bias. Further, if a population contains many patients with decompensated cirrhosis, results would be expected to be skewed at the higher levels of SSM.",
      "Combination NILDA",
      "In a retrospective multicenter study of 518 patients with compensated cirrhosis from 5 centers in Europe and Canada, investigators aimed to develop noninvasive test-based risk prediction models using LSM (by TE), platelet counts, and spleen diameter with the calculation of an LSPS score and platelet-spleen ratio in comparison to HVPG measurement.82The study population included 229 patients with compensated cirrhosis who had LSM and HVPG measurements and 179 patients with LSPS/platelet-spleen ratio and HVPG measurement; the majority of patients had a viral etiology of cirrhosis and two-thirds had CSPH. The LSPS-based model had the best predictive value for CSPH (AUROC, 0.88), followed by a combination of LSM >20 kPa plus platelet count ≥150,000/mcL (AUROC, 0.85) and LSM >20 kPa (AUROC, 0.82). However, the authors believed that the models could not identify patients at low risk of CSPH.",
      "A multicenter retrospective study of 836 patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease, including some reported in other studies, as well as a new group of 220 patients with NASH, examined NILDA and the severity of portal hypertension.34The authors examined 2 models to predict CSPH, one using LSM and 1 using LSM plus platelet count. In 117 patients with LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL, 113 did not have CSPH (NPV of 97%), suggesting that this combination (LSM ≤15 kPa and platelets ≥150,000/mcL) may be used to exclude CSPH.",
      "In another study, the combination of LSM and FIB-4 was examined.35LSM plus FIB-4 showed the best performance in predicting CSPH with an AUROC 0.8155 and using a FIB-4 cutoff of 1.85 and an LSM cutoff of 21.3 kPa, the sensitivity for CSPH was 50% with a specificity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, patients with an FIB-4 <1.85 and an LSM <21.3 were unlikely to have CSPH.",
      "Fibrosis reversal and NILDA assessment of portal hypertension",
      "In multiple different liver diseases, evidence suggests that fibrosis and even cirrhosis is reversible (see by Rockey83,84for review). Several studies have demonstrated that eradication of HCV is associated with reductions in HVPG and LSM (See also Table 9 in the guideline by Sterling et al37). For example, a study of 100 patients with HCV and SVR who underwent HVPG and LSM before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy and SVR showed that LSM levels decreased after viral eradication and correlated with HVPG levels.31In a follow-up to that study, including an additional 30 patients, 67 patients were found to have CSPH85with a mean baseline LSM of 27.7 kPa and HVPG of 16.2 mm Hg. At an average of 6.6 months after completion of direct antiviral agents therapy, LSM was reduced by an average of 4.6 kPa (HVPG was reduced by 2.6 mm Hg), and in the subgroup of 40 patients with an HVPG decrease of >10%, the reduction in LSM was 6.8 kPa (HVPG reduction was 5.1 mm Hg). However, although LSM decreased during treatment and was correlated with an HVPG decrease ≥10%, the AUROC value for the prediction of HVPG was below 0.8—raising questions about the clinical utility of such an approach.",
      "In a study of 276 patients with HCV with advanced chronic liver disease (presumably cirrhosis), with a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 8.6, and of whom nearly 25% had varices, and who achieved SVR with direct-acting antiviral medications, LSM had an AUROC of 0.88 for predicting future hepatic decompensation.86Further, a follow-up LSM of <12.4 kPa and/or a follow-up LSM plus von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio <0.95 (found in 57% of patients) to rule out CSPH was associated with no hepatic decompensation events, potentially consistent with fibrosis reversal and reduced portal pressure.",
      "In a pooled analysis of a number of published European studies, a total of 324 patients with HCV and pretreatment HVPG ≥6 mm Hg who had SVR after direct antiviral agent treatment, in whom the pretreatment/post-treatment prevalence of CSPH was 80%/54%, the correlation between LSM/HVPG increased from pretreatment to post-treatment (r=0.45 vs. 0.60).87Post-treatment LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL excluded CSPH in 99% of patients, and an LSM ≥25 kPa had a sensitivity for CSPH of 94%. In a separate validation cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (also compensated advanced chronic liver disease), no patient with LSM <12 kPa and platelets >150,000/mcL had a decompensation event within 3 years; in patients with post-treatment LSM ≥25 kPa, the 3-year decompensation risk was 10%, and was 1% in those meeting none of the above criteria.",
      "In a study of 112 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients who achieved SVR, HVPG, LSM, and the ELF test were obtained before treatment and at 12 months.32It was shown that HVPG, LSM, and ELF all decreased after SVR in the cohort, including in both the patients with cirrhosis (43% had fibrosis regression) and those with less severe fibrosis (over 70% had fibrosis regression). In the 34 patients with cirrhosis in whom LSM was obtained, LSM decreased from 25.3 (16.5–32.8) to 14.5 (9.9–22.1) kPa (p<0.001), with 62% of patients having a reduction in LSM. One-year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to exclude CSPH (AUROC, 0.888)."

      "NILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH. However, there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical. From a practical standpoint, the available data are extremely heterogeneous regarding specific liver disease studied, and the cutoffs used to predict CSPH vary considerably. From a biological standpoint, it is important to recognize that intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated so that data obtained in patients with active disease may not be relevant in those with treated disease. There are also inherent technical limitations to the performance of elastography, and accurate measurements are not always possible to obtain (particularly in patients with obesity and in those with ascites). Although there are fewer technical limitations with LSM techniques, SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen, which may be technically demanding with TE (different from other ultrasound methods of elastography where the spleen is visualized directly). Finally, available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels.",
      "Given the limitations of currently available studies, and in particular studies included in this systematic review (Table 4), as well as advances in therapy for many chronic liver diseases and the desire to monitor patients during and after therapy noninvasively, it is clear that much more study in this area is needed. Specific questions that need to be answered include the following:",
      "In closing, although research in the study of portal hypertension is limited by the invasiveness of measuring HVPG, which is used as a reference standard, it is hoped that this barrier will not preclude much-needed further investigation.",
