Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (i.e., ability to diagnose patients with and without the disease or condition based on the test), 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstandingAbbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; FN, false negative; FP, false positive; N, all negative tests;P, all positive tests; TN, true negative; TP, true positive.IMAGING TECHNIQUESImaging techniques have been utilized for many years in the evaluation of CLD (Table 5). In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (i.e., ability to diagnose patients with and without the disease or condition based on the test), 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstandingAbbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; FN, false negative; FP, false positive; N, all negative tests;P, all positive tests; TN, true negative; TP, true positive.IMAGING TECHNIQUESImaging techniques have been utilized for many years in the evaluation of CLD (Table 5). In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population. Correctly detect patients who are ill who have the condition. High sensitivity helps rule out the disease (few false negatives).SpecificityTN/(TN+FP)Not dependent on population.

In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (i.e., ability to diagnose patients with and without the disease or condition based on the test), 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstandingAbbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; FN, false negative; FP, false positive; N, all negative tests;P, all positive tests; TN, true negative; TP, true positive.IMAGING TECHNIQUESImaging techniques have been utilized for many years in the evaluation of CLD (Table 5). In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population. Correctly detect patients who are ill who have the condition. High sensitivity helps rule out the disease (few false negatives).SpecificityTN/(TN+FP)Not dependent on population.

In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (i.e., ability to diagnose patients with and without the disease or condition based on the test), 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstandingAbbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; FN, false negative; FP, false positive; N, all negative tests;P, all positive tests; TN, true negative; TP, true positive.IMAGING TECHNIQUESImaging techniques have been utilized for many years in the evaluation of CLD (Table 5). In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population. Correctly detect patients who are ill who have the condition. High sensitivity helps rule out the disease (few false negatives).SpecificityTN/(TN+FP)Not dependent on population.

In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (i.e., ability to diagnose patients with and without the disease or condition based on the test), 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstandingAbbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; FN, false negative; FP, false positive; N, all negative tests;P, all positive tests; TN, true negative; TP, true positive.IMAGING TECHNIQUESImaging techniques have been utilized for many years in the evaluation of CLD (Table 5). In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (i.e., ability to diagnose patients with and without the disease or condition based on the test), 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstandingAbbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; FN, false negative; FP, false positive; N, all negative tests;P, all positive tests; TN, true negative; TP, true positive.IMAGING TECHNIQUESImaging techniques have been utilized for many years in the evaluation of CLD (Table 5). In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

      "PURPOSE AND SCOPEChronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with approximately two million annual deaths worldwide and is an enormous health burden.1,2The majority of liver-related outcomes, including liver failure, portal hypertension (PHTN) with its complications, and HCC, occur almost exclusively in those with advanced CLD. Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ruben Hernaez, Alfred Sidney Barritt IV, and the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee, PGC, for their expertise, patience, and editorial guidance, Elizabeth C.

      "PURPOSE AND SCOPEChronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with approximately two million annual deaths worldwide and is an enormous health burden.1,2The majority of liver-related outcomes, including liver failure, portal hypertension (PHTN) with its complications, and HCC, occur almost exclusively in those with advanced CLD. Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines Committee commissioned a diverse group of experts across multiple disciplines in the field of adult and pediatric liver disease to develop guidelines and guidance statements along with a systematic review covering imaging-based NILDA to answer specific clinically focused questions (“patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome,” henceforth PICO) for the most common CLD etiologies (Table 1). Blood-based NILDA and NILDA for the detection of PHTN are discussed elsewhere.5,6These guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD to provide guidance (see algorithm summarized at the end of this document). NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is discussed elsewhere.7TABLE 1 -Patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions in NILDAImaging-based with or without blood-based for fibrosis or steatosis in adultsPICO 1In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 2In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 3In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?PICO 4In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?PICO 5In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, do longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?PICO 6In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, or transient elastography (TE) with CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy, or MR-proton-density-fat-fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Imaging-based testing in childrenPICO 7In children with CLD (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, BA, Alagille, α1AT, CFLD), are imaging-based tests accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; F, fibrosis stage; MR, magnetic resonance; PICO, Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome; α1AT, α1 antitrypsin disease.METHODOLOGYOverall approachThe guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).TABLE 2 -Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (GRADE) system approacha1.

These statements considered additional sources and the clinical experience of the authors with regard to noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Technical remarks and supporting evidence for graded and ungraded statements are included with recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation.Consensus processFor all guideline statements, we pursued a modified Delphi approach to define the final set of recommendations11using previously described methodology and also adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.12Statements with<75% agreement were rediscussed with (i) review of the scores, (ii) discussion to identify the reasons for variation, (iii) revision of suboptimally worded statements for accuracy by consensus, (iv) deletion of statements that were deemed problematic or irrelevant by consensus, and (v) identification of additional statements deemed necessary for inclusion in the list of statements. All final guideline statements were unanimously agreed upon by all writing group members.HISTOPATHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NILDAFibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25TABLE 3A -Staging of fibrosis across multiple liver diseases and corresponding classification scoresFibrosis stage0F1F2F3F4Significant fibrosisAdvanced fibrosisCirrhosisScheuer/Batts-Ludwig (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)13,14No fibrosisEnlarged, fibrotic portal tractsPeriportal or portal-portal septa but intact architectureFibrosis with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosisProbable or definite cirrhosisKnodell (Viral and autoimmune hepatitis)15No fibrosisFibrous portal expansionN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisIshak (Various etiologies)160: No fibrosis1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging5: Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)6: Cirrhosis (probable or definite)METAVIR (Various etiologies)17No fibrosisStellate enlargement of portal tract but without septa formationEnlargement of portal tract with rare septa formationNumerous septa without cirrhosisCirrhosisLudwig (PBC and PSC)18N/AN/AN/ABridging fibrosisCirrhosisAlcohol-associated liver disease (alcohol hepatitis histological score)19No fibrosis or portal fibrosisExpansive periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisBrunt-Kleiner (NAFLD)20,21No fibrosis1A: delicate perisinusoidal 1B: dense perisinusoidal 1C: portal-only fibrosisPerisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosisBridging fibrosisCirrhosisAbbreviations: N/A, not applicable; P-C, port-central; P-P, portal-portal.TABLE 3B -Assessment and grading of steatosis based on the percent of hepatocytes affectedDegree of steatosis0 (Normal or minimal)1 (Mild)2 (Moderate)3 (Severe)<5%5%-33%34%-66%>66%Note:Based on Brunt et al.20and Kleiner et al.21ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF NONINVASIVE MARKERSWe used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28TABLE 4 -Diagnostic performance indices used in NILDADiagnostic indexCalculationCommentsSensitivityTP/(TP+FN)Not dependent on population.

In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (i.e., ability to diagnose patients with and without the disease or condition based on the test), 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstandingAbbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; FN, false negative; FP, false positive; N, all negative tests;P, all positive tests; TN, true negative; TP, true positive.IMAGING TECHNIQUESImaging techniques have been utilized for many years in the evaluation of CLD (Table 5). In clinical practice, standard two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are frequently used to identify features of cirrhosis; however, they are not sufficiently sensitive for compensated cirrhosis or precirrhotic stages.29Key imaging features that allow for diagnosis of cirrhosis or PHTN include a coarse or heterogenous nodular liver, dilated portal vein (>12 mm) or presence of collaterals, recanalization of the umbilical vein, ascites, and splenomegaly (most frequently defined as≥13 cm but varies depending on patient sex, size, and morphology of the spleen).TABLE 5 -Operational characteristics of imaging-based techniques for assessment of fibrosisScroll left or right to view entire table.MethodAvailabilityCostEvidenceROI sizeROI placementFailure rateReasons for failureUnitsBrand/vendorTEWidespread in hepatology officesLowWell validatedSmallRestricted - no guidance<5%-15%High BMI (M probe) ascitesYoung’s modulus (kPa)Fibroscan, Echosens, ParisARFI methodsModerateLowModerate validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardSmall (pSWE)Medium (2D-SWE)Flexible up to 8-cm depth with US guidance<5%-15%High BMISWE --Young’s modulus (kPa)pSWE --Wave speed (m/s)pSWE: Virtual Touch Quantification [a type of ARFI] by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; and Elast-PQ [EPIQ7 ultrasound], Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA2D-SWE: Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification by Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; SWE by Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, Hologic, Inc., France; ElastQ, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands; Acoustic Structure Quantification by Canon; 2D-SWE LOGIQ E9 ShearWave Elastography, GE Healthcare, WI; Hitachi Medical Systems, Japan; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy; and Samsung Medison Co., Seoul, KoreaMRELimitedHighLimited validation in single etiology CLD with histology as reference standardLargeWhole organ coverage (within confidence maps)<5%Liver iron deposition, Large ascites, Very high BMI, 3T (for 2D GRE)Shear modulus (kPa)Resoundant (available on GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips)Abbreviations: GRE, gradient recalled echo; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography; US, ultrasound.US-based elastographyTransient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).TABLE 6A -Clinical factors affecting performance of blood- and imaging-based noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosisClinical conditionTools affectedCommentsObesity32,35–39LSMAlthough an XL probe can remediate TE-LSM failure in most cases with SCD≥25 mm, extreme obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) can result in TE-LSM failure.Depending on body frame, extreme obesity can also affect transmission of mechanical wave, leading to MRE failure, but this is far less common than TE failures.SWE acoustic signal transmission can also be affected by obesity, resulting in failure.Narrow intercostal spaceTEIf not corrected by repositioning, leads to failure or falsely elevated estimationAscites36LSMTE affected more that SWE, with MR being the least affectedAffects transmission of vibration and mechanical signals, leading to failureAlthough SWE and MR are relatively insensitive to small amounts of ascites, large amounts can lead to failure.SplenectomyAPRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, attenuated thrombocytopenia from splenectomy gives a falsely lower estimation.Splenomegaly as an imaging sign of PHTN cannot be assessed.Thrombocytopenia (not related to PHTN)APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNFSBecause these tools use platelets as a biomarker of PHTN, thrombocytopenia from other conditions gives a falsely higher estimation.Iron overload40MREAffects T2 signaling leading to failureSteatosis41–43TEAlthough its clinical impact is unclear, moderate to severe steatosis causes TE-LSM to overestimate fibrosis.Active alcohol use44FibroTestHepascoreIncreases GGT, leading to falsely elevated estimationHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hepatic congestion of cardiac/pulmonary vascular origin45LSMRetrograde vascular congestion results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisObstructive cholestasis46LSMLarge bile duct obstruction results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisHepatic infiltration47LSMAmyloid or tumoral infiltration results in increased stiffness of hepatic parenchyma and falsely elevated estimation of fibrosisElevated ALT and/or AST (inflammatory hepatitis)33,44,48APRIFIB-4FibroindexFibroMeterNAFLD fibrosis scoreLSMElevated aminotransferases occurring in relation to acute or acute-on-chronic hepatitis lead to a falsely elevated estimation of fibrosis.Chronic kidney disease49–51FibroindexAPRIFIB-4FibroMeterTE-LSMElevated urea levels can result in falsely lower estimation.Patients undergoing hemodialysis tend to have lower ALT and AST levels, resulting in falsely lower estimation.Hemofiltration can result in lower stiffness in patients with baseline fluid overload.MalnutritionNAFLD fibrosis scoreAlbumin reduction that is disproportionate to liver dysfunction results in falsely elevated estimation.Inflammatory conditionFibroTestFibroindexHepascoreFibroMeterCan result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated FibroindexHemolysisFibrotestDecreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimationGilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseasesFibroTestHepascoreCan result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimationPostprandial52LSMNFSLiver stiffness increases up to 26% have been described for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal.

ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis.Magnetic resonance (MR)-based elastographyMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).PICO 1: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, alcohol-associated liver disease [ALD]) or cholestatic (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statements:In adults with chronic HCV, chronic HBV, and NAFLD, AASLD recommends using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)In adults with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease, AASLD suggests using imaging-based NILDA tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere is considerable experience with the use of TE-LSM in HCV and HBV, with substantial reliability for discriminating between significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The effect of parenchymal inflammation and viremia must be considered when interpreting results.The majority of data on TE-LSM are derived from viremic subjects (positive for HCV RNA or HBV DNA); therefore, their use in treated subjects (negative HCV RNA or HBV DNA) is poorly defined.In NAFLD, TE-LSM has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detection of fibrosis but is limited by technical issues in certain patients (e.g., those with obesity). Although less data exist for MRE-LSM, it is a reliable method to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4) and cirrhosis (F4) and particularly useful for the discrimination of advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in NAFLD.We acknowledge that there has been a recent multisociety endorsement of a nomenclature change from NAFLD to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH.For patients with ALD and cholestatic liver disease, the evidence for use of imaging-based NILDA to assess fibrosis is not as extensive as for HCV, HBV, and NAFLD. Furthermore, the effect of acute-on-chronic flares and extrahepatic biliary obstruction must be considered when interpreting results.Clinicians should be aware of pitfalls and limitations when ordering and interpreting imaging-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (Table 6A).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEIn the systematic review developed to address this PICO question,67imaging-based methods showed acceptable to outstanding diagnostic accuracy, with most sensitivities and specificities in the range of 70%-100%, and with narrow confidence intervals (i.e., more precise) and higher reliability than blood-based NILDA68to detect advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Figure 1). All imaging NILDA methods evaluated had predominantly moderate to high strength of evidence and low-to-moderate risk of bias, although there were more publications for TE-LSM than pSWE-LSM and fewer for 2D-SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM. Some MRE-LSM studies could not be included in analyses because they included heterogenous populations.69However, in a meta-analysis of studies in mixed disease populations, MRE-LSM had summary AUROCs of 0.88, 0.93, and 0.92 for the identification of F2-4, F3-4, or F4, respectively.65Importantly, cutoff values for each stage varied across liver diseases and between studies. Below follows a discussion of the use of imaging NILDA in specific liver diseases.FIGURE 1:Systematic review of imaging-based NILDA thresholds for detection of fibrosis. Systematic review pooled sensitivities and specificities for each imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment modality, according to disease (HCV, HBV, NAFLD, ALD) and fibrosis staging (clinically significant fibrosis [F2-4], advanced fibrosis [F2-3], cirrhosis [F4]). The diamond-shaped dot on a continuous line shows the pooled sensitivity with its 95% confidence interval, whereas the diamond-shaped dot on a dotted line shows the pooled specificity with its 95% confidence interval. An arrow at the end of a line means that the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity or specificity continued below the 50% sensitivity/specificity limit. The green color represents high strength of evidence, whereas the blue color represents moderate to low strength of evidence. An asterisk next to each line stands for low risk of bias, otherwise, high to moderate risk of bias must be assumed. The best mean (range) cutoff value identified by the systematic review at each stage of fibrosis can be found immediately below each method, along with the number of studies summarized between parentheses. Abbreviations: MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; TE, transient elastography.HCVFor the detection of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), all US-based methods had acceptable to outstanding accuracy, with pSWE-LSM showing wider confidence intervals for specificity. For the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, all US-based methods had excellent to outstanding accuracy with sensitivities and specificities in the high 80%-90%.67These findings agree are consistent with other meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM in chronic HCV, which also found AUROC in the excellent to outstanding range.60,70Based on two studies of patients with HCV, MRE-LSM showed acceptable to outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all fibrosis staging categories in the range of 76%-100%.71,72HBVAll US-based methods had acceptable to excellent accuracy for detection of significant fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in untreated HBV. TE-LSM and pSWE-LSM showed a wider variability in sensitivity (TE and pSWE) and specificity (pSWE), particularly for significant fibrosis. Of note, a single study assessing MRE-LSM had the highest sensitivities and specificities, 95%-100%, respectively.67Another meta-analysis comparing MRE-LSM (n=1470) and TE-LSM (n=3641) found similar results to ours for both techniques.73Importantly, we could not perform a separate analysis for patients with either high or low alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations to select an optimal cutoff value in the setting of inflammation, an important variable that can increase LSM and can falsely elevate the fibrosis estimate.48This is an important consideration, as higher TE cutoff values have been recommended for patients with elevated ALT, and TE has been deemed inaccurate to estimate fibrosis when ALT is 5-10 times the upper limit of normal.74NAFLDThe discriminative capacity for significant fibrosis among the US-based methods was acceptable to excellent, with the widest variability for US-based methods observed for pSWE-LSM. However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80ALDA limited number of studies in ALD have assessed TE-LSM, pSWE-LSM, and 2D-SWE-LSM for identification of significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.67They all showed excellent to outstanding performance with test sensitivity increasing at more advanced stages of fibrosis, except for 2D-SWE-LSM, which was evaluated for the detection of advanced fibrosis only (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95%). A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80Similar to viral hepatitis, for both NAFLD and ALD, one must consider aminotransferase levels, as LSM is less reliable when ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are >100 U/mL,33,82particularly in the setting of alcohol-associated hepatitis.83A meta-analysis confirmed that AST and elevated bilirubin are directly associated with LSM in ALD.44Although inflammation, active alcohol use, and bilirubinostasis/cholestasis are best described as TE-LSM modifiers, they likely affect fibrosis estimates with most imaging-based NILDA.Other CLDTE-LSM was the only method investigated in patients with HCV/HIV coinfection, showing a similar sensitivity (83% for significant fibrosis and 83-100% for cirrhosis) and specificity (74% for significant fibrosis and 84-93% for cirrhosis) when compared to HCV monoinfection.67The data were also limited for cholestatic diseases. In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86Data in post-transplant patients are limited and studies mainly addressed populations with mixed causes of liver disease prior to transplant. Using TE-LSM, a threshold of 10.5 kPa identified recipients who developed F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.94 at a fixed sensitivity of 90% and an NPV of 99%.87Another study with 2D-SWE found a median LSM of 12 kPa (range of 10-13) to detect F3-4 stage at lower sensitivity and NPV (76% and 94%); however, recipients with an LSM≥11 kPa had lower survival irrespective of their true histopathological fibrosis stage.88Two meta-analyses focused on post-transplant studies showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the diagnosis of F2-4 or F3-4 with TE-LSM or ARFI methods while outperforming blood-based NILDA such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4).89,90A pooled analysis of 141 transplant recipients also showed excellent to outstanding accuracy for the identification of F3-4 and F4 with MRE at thresholds of 4.1 and 5.9 kPa, respectively.91Although rejection92and other allograft complications93can affect liver stiffness, the high sensitivity and NPV of LSM makes imaging-based NILDA a valuable monitoring tool to guide the need for biopsies in the assessment of recurrent disease and allograft health.85,94This is particularly important for patients transplanted for conditions with a high risk of recurrence and progressive disease (e.g., NASH 38% recurrence rate) or alloreactivity, such as immune-mediated liver diseases.95PICO 2: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is one imaging-based NILDA more accurate than another in staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD recommends utilizing either US-based elastography methods or MRE to stage fibrosis. Depending on local availability and expertise, it is reasonable to perform MRE as an investigation when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is needed or for patients in whom the accuracy of US-based elastography might be compromised (ungraded statement).TECHNICAL REMARKSUS-based elastography methods are comparable overall because of their similar performance.In patients with chronic HBV and HCV, different US-based elastography methods have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and good to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).In patients with NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD), different US-based elastography methods have comparable, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant (F2-4) or advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting cirrhosis (F4).There are insufficient data comparing different imaging-based NILDA in cholestatic liver diseases.There are a limited number of studies comparing US elastography and MRE. Although many studies of MRE-LSM were not included in our systematic review because they had heterogenous patient populations or lacked histology as a reference standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE-LSM for advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4) was typically above 90%. More head-to-head comparisons between MRE and US-based elastography are needed to determine improved accuracy of the former.There are differences in shear wave speeds provided by ARFI-LSM techniques due to the large number of vendors with different implementations, which makes the comparison between studies difficult. In contrast, MRE uses standardized acquisition and processing, which makes the LSM values obtained with clinical MRE platforms generally comparable.Interpretation study results comparing imaging-based NILDA should consider multiple potential effect modifiers and confounding factors such as whether the study was performed in a screening versus diagnostic environment, population included (i.e., whether at high or low risk for fibrosis), the sample size, and whether cutoffs for various fibrosis stages were used a priori or were based on the sampled population.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALETE compared to pSWE and 2D-SWEpSWE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM methods have been introduced more recently than TE-LSM and are thus less well studied in the literature. In patients with HBV96–98and HCV,39,99,100data demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for liver fibrosis staging. Studies comparing TE-LSM to pSWE-LSM101and 2D-SWE-LSM102,103have found these methods to provide similar,66,96–99,101,104–106superior,98,102,103or inferior100,107diagnostic performance to TE-LSM (Table 7). However, when comparing the imaging tests head-to-head with liver histology in studies using validated cutoff values, there do not appear to be significant differences among the imaging elastography techniques in cohorts of patients with HCV, HBV, and NAFLD.67TABLE 7 -Summary results from systematic review of imaging-based biomarkers for fibrosis stageDiseaseFibrosis stageTE cutoffpSWE/2D-SWE cutoffaReferencesPOR (95% CI)HCVF0-1 vs. F2-46.5-6.7 kPa1.2 m/s (pSWE)107,1082.67 (0.40-17.66)F0-2 vs. F3-49.6 kPa1.6 m/s (pSWE)1002.20 (0.28-17.04)F0-3 vs. F412.2-13.1 kPa1.8-2 m/s (pSWE)100,1072.18 (0.56-8.49)HBVF0-1 vs. F2-46.9-7.3 kPa7.1 kPa (2D-SWE)102,1040.40 (0.16-1.01)F0-3 vs. F410.6-11.2 kPa11.3 kPa (2D-SWE)1040.71 (0.10-5.24)1.75 m/s (pSWE)1050.71 (0.20-2.47)NAFLDF0-3 vs. F416.1 kPa2 m/s (pSWE)372.36 (0.86-6.48)am/s for pSWE (which can be converted to kPa for comparisons), kPa for 2D-SWE.Abbreviation: TE, transient elastography.MRE compared to US elastography methodsGiven the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119PICO 3: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, are imaging-based NILDA more accurate than blood-based NILDA?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD, AASLD suggests imaging-based NILDA be incorporated into the initial fibrosis staging process because it is more accurate than blood-based NILDA. (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMore than half of studies performing imaging-based to blood-based NILDA head-to-head comparisons that meet entry criteria showed improved accuracy for imaging-based tests, whereas no comparison favored blood-based tests (Table 8).Use of multiple threshold values for each analyzed stage of fibrosis in the case of blood-based NILDA made it challenging to provide precise diagnostic estimates.Choice of tests among imaging-based and blood-based NILDA is based on local expertise, test availability, test cost, and patient’s preference.TABLE 8 -Components of blood-based biomarker algorithms for fibrosisaScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesStudy cohortClinical variablesIndirect markersDirect markersModel algorithmAPRI,120HCV—AST, platelets—[(AST level/ULN)/platelet count (109/L)]×100Fibrosis-4 Index(FIB-4),121HIV-HCVAgeAST, ALT, platelets—Age (y)×AST (U/L)Platelet count (109/L)×√ALT (U/L)NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),122NAFLDAge, BMI, IFG/diabetesAST, ALT, platelets, albumin—−1.675+(0.037×age)+(0.094×BMI)+1.13×IFG/diabetes (yes=1, no=0)+0.99×(AST/ALT ratio) − (0.013×platelets) − (0.66×albumin)Easy Liver Fibrosis Test (eLIFT),123MixedAge, SexGGT, AST, platelets, prothrombin index—Component weighted scores (0-4)FibroTest,124HCV—α2M, GGT, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, ApoA-I1—ProprietaryELF,125MixedAge—HA, PIIINP, TIMP-1ProprietaryFibroSpect II,126HCV—α2MHA, TIMP-1ProprietaryHepaScore,127HCVAge, SexTotal bilirubin, α2M, GGTHAProprietaryFibroMeter,128MixedAgePlatelets, prothrombin index, urea, AST, α2MHAProprietaryaOriginal study cohorts are referenced.Abbreviations: APoA-1, apolipoprotein A-1;

However, there were some inconsistencies between calculated DOR and original AUROC. For example, for the detection of cirrhosis, results were mixed with some studies showing TE-LSM superiority over APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest,108,129,132,142whereas other studies showed no difference in accuracy108,130,133,138,140,141(Table 9).HCV/HIVNo difference in diagnostic performance between TE-LSM and blood tests (FIB-4 and FibroTest) was observed for detection of significant fibrosis based on two studies.143,144TE had better performance than APRI for one of two tested cutoff values (i.e., 0.5).HBVDiagnostic performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), FibroTest, and TE-LSM were similar for prediction of significant fibrosis, whereas TE-LSM and FibroTest had higher AUROCs than ELF for predicting advanced fibrosis, and TE-LSM predicted cirrhosis more accurately than ELF and FibroTest in treatment-naïve patients with HBV.163In another study of treatment-naïve patients with HBV, TE-LSM outperformed ELF for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.164In our systematic review,67four showed improved accuracy of US-based elastography over APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, based on DOR.148–151Of note, 2 studies demonstrated higher AUROC for TE-LSM compared to blood tests for F2-F4147and for cirrhosis.151HBV/HIVIn one study not included in our systematic review, TE-LSM outperformed APRI and FIB-4 for detection of advanced fibrosis in HBV/HIV coinfected adults on combined antiretroviral therapy.165NAFLDA meta-analysis comparing blood-based, US elastography, or MRE in NAFLD (64 articles, 13,046 subjects) showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing any fibrosis and cirrhosis.77The AUROC values using BARD score, APRI, FIB-4, NFS, TE-LSM M probe/XL probe, SWE-LSM, and MRE-LSM for diagnosing advanced fibrosis were 0.76, 0.77, 0.84, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM were significantly higher than all blood-based NILDA.77Improved performance for F3-4 was also found for MRE when compared to FIB-4 and NFS113and for TE-LSM when compared to FIB-4, NFS, BARD, and APRI.166However, evidence is not consistent on improved accuracy of imaging-based over blood-based NILDA for NAFLD. A large study comparing NFS, FIB-4, ELF, and TE-LSM (AUROC 0.74 for NFS, 0.78 for FIB-4, and 0.80 for ELF and TE) for the detection of F3-478and another study comparing proprietary blood markers and TE-LSM found no difference; TE-LSM did outperform FIB-4 and NFS.167Similarly, a third study found TE-LSM and FibroMeterV2G (second generation FibroMeter) to be the two best-performing tests (F3-4 AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively).167Of note, the pooled analysis of 2 studies showed superior performance for TE-LSM over FIB-4 for detection of F3-4 in our systematic review,155,158but no differences were identified in the 6 remaining studies.153,154,156,157,159,160ALDIn a prospective study comparing ELF, FibroTest, and TE-LSM, the latter had the best accuracy for F3-4 with an AUROC of 0.97,161although another study found equivalent performance among TE-LSM, FibroTest, and PGAA (an index combining prothrombin time, gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], apolipoprotein A1, and α-2-macroglobulin).162In our systematic review,67US-based elastography demonstrated higher performance for F3-4 and F4 when compared to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest168,169(Table 9).Other CLDNILDA for AIH is covered elsewhere.7A systematic review of 16 studies in AIH hepatitis showed that TE-LSM had better performance for detection of F3-4 compared to APRI and FIB-4.170In a small PSC prospective study, TE-LSM performance was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid but superior to APRI, FIB-4, and Mayo risk score for F2-4 and F3-4.169In 103 patients with PBC, TE-LSM performed better than blood-based NILDA (APRI, FIB-4, hyaluronic acid, AST/ALT ratio, and Mayo risk score) for diagnosis of F2-4, F3-4, and cirrhosis.170These results contrasted with a mixed etiology cohort revealing comparable diagnostic performance for TE-LSM, FibroTest, and ELF.171PICO 4: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, is the combination of an imaging-based NILDA with a blood-based NILDA more accurate than a single test for staging fibrosis (F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4) using histopathology as the reference?Guideline Statement:In adults with CLD undergoing initial fibrosis staging, AASLD suggests combining blood-based and imaging-based NILDA, particularly for the detection of significant fibrosis (F2-4) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4). (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)TECHNICAL REMARKSMost studies have included TE-LSM, and there are limited data on MRE-LSM or other US elastography methods, combined with blood-based markers.Tests can be utilized in a concomitant or sequential fashion. Although synchronous combinations of blood-based NILDA and TE-LSM reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis, they result in a “gray zone” classification and thus increase accuracy at the expense of increasing the number of needed liver biopsies.Improved accuracy for F2-4, F3-4, and F4 for combined versus single testing, varies according to the tests under consideration and how they are combined in a synchronous or sequential fashion.Utilization of blood-based and imaging-based NILDA algorithms have been validated for specific pragmatic applications, such as population-based screening, referral pathways in primary care, or staging in specialty clinics, which the clinician will need to consider prior to combining NILDA tests and drawing clinical conclusions from their results.The studies on chronic HCV are from the interferon era, and there were no studies that assessed combined tests relative to liver histology following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In patients with chronic HCV (with viremia), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography improves diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in chronic HBV were from Asian cohorts, and there were no studies using combined tests to assess fibrosis in non-Asian cohorts. In patients with chronic HBV (HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative), the addition of blood-based NILDA to US-based elastography does not improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant fibrosis.Combination studies in NAFLD (not necessarily MASLD) included TE-LSM in the assessment of advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. In patients with NAFLD, the sequential combination of imaging-based elastography and blood-based NILDA may improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting advanced fibrosis.There are very few studies in patients with other CLD.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALECombination algorithms of blood-based biomarkers and elastography were initially developed for the management of patients with HCV. The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C). Combined noninvasive approaches, usually in sequence, may have pragmatic indications for use in clinical practice to identify advanced stage, improve population-based screening, and simplify referral pathways from primary to tertiary care.186,187However, the choice of which noninvasive test is done first (blood- or imaging-based NILDA) has not been established.TABLE 10A -Combination of elastography and blood-based markers for diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F2-4)ReferencesNo. of biopsies (F2-4 prevalence)Elastography type and optimal LSMSingle test AUC*Combined test AUCCommentsHCV172183 (74%)TE-LSM 7.1 kPaTE-LSM=0.83FT=0.85APRI=0.78TE-LSM+APRI=0.84TE-LSM+FT=0.88TE-LSM+FT+APRI=0.88Agreement FT and TE-LSM 77%; biopsy confirmed F2-3=84%HCV173729 (58.4%)TE-LSM NATE-LSM=0.79FM=0.81TE-LSM+FM=0.85Improved AUC for combination compared to FM or TE-LSM aloneHCV141382 (47%)TE-LSM 5.2 kPaTE-LSM=0.82FM=0.83FT=0.81APRI=0.78ELF= 0.78HS= 0.82FIB-4= 0.78Not providedAccuracy increased from 70%-73% (single test) to 78%-82% for TE-LSM combinationHBV9681 (63%)ARFI 1.295 m/sTE-LSM 8.3 kPaARFI=0.76TE-LSM=0.75Forns=0.73AccuracyARFI+Forns=90.7%TE-LSM+Forns=76.1%Discordance 24%-34% for synchronous testsHBV9892 (72%)ARFI 1.27 m/sTE-LSM 6.6 kPaARFI=0.91TE-LSM=0.87APRI=0.79ARFI+TE-LSM+APRI=0.92No difference for linear combination over elastography aloneHBV17470 (34%)TE-LSM 7.5 kPaTE-LSM=0.87Blood markers=0.86TE-LSM+markers=0.86No difference for combination compared with TE-LSM or blood-marker panel (HA, PIIINP, type IV collagen, ALT, AST) aloneHBV145101 (55%)ARFI 0.97 and 1.36 m/sARFI=0.70APRI=0.62FIB-4=0.64ARFI+APRI+FIB-4—not providedNew thresholds for APRI/FIB-4.

Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.HBVA study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy.NAFLDA study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79Other CLDFew studies have evaluated combination elastography and blood-based markers to assess fibrosis in nonviral or non-NAFLD CLD. A study in 114 patients with PBC noted no differences in diagnostic accuracy for significant, advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis using synchronous combinations of TE-LSM and simple blood-based markers APRI, FIB-4, Forns Index, or FibroIndex compared to TE alone.177A study in 193 patients with ALD determined that combined TE+FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracy to TE-LSM alone for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.162A study in 289 patients with ALD found no incremental change in diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis combining TE with ELF or other blood-based tests, including FibroTest, APRI, and FIB-4.161PICO 5: In adult patients with CLD, including hepatocellular (HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, NAFLD, ALD) or cholestatic (PSC, PBC) disorders, does longitudinal imaging-based NILDA accurately predict progression or regression of fibrosis in its natural history or response to therapy relative to longitudinal hepatic histological evaluation as the reference?Guideline Statements:AASLD suggests against the use of imaging-based NILDA as a standalone test to assess regression or progression of liver fibrosis. (ungraded statement)AASLD suggests interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context that considers the effect of NILDA modifiers and other supportive evidence of improving or worsening clinical course. (ungraded statement)In patients with treated HBV and HCV, AASLD suggests using the LSM obtained prior to the start of antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal NILDA parameter for the effect of prognostication, given the limited amount of evidence associating LSM with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSLSM is affected by disease activity parameters other than fibrosis (Table 6A), and there is still insufficient evidence that changes in LSM values accurately identify regression or progression of fibrosis.In limited studies with serial imaging-based NILDA and paired liver biopsies, LSM changed in parallel with the increase or decrease in histological fibrosis in patients with HCV, HBV, or NAFLD. Reduced LSM after HCV eradication and HBV suppressive treatment suggests some degree of reversion of fibrosis, whereas the increase in stiffness during long-term follow-up in PBC and PSC suggests fibrosis progression.Reductions in LSM immediately following antiviral treatment should not be interpreted as clear evidence of fibrosis regression. Absolute cutoffs for meaningful changes following viral eradication have not been established.Although promising data on the utility of imaging-based NILDA to study fibrosis trajectory and clinical course are accumulating, there is need for further research to determine whether they can be used alone to predict histologic change in fibrosis following disease-modifying therapies in all CLDs.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMultiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).TABLE 11 -Longitudinal studies investigating the role of liver stiffness in the identification of fibrosis regression or progressionScroll left or right to view entire table.Author, year of study; assessed tool (reference)CLD and stagingBiopsy N (follow-up n)Change in biopsy fibrosisNILDA changeNILDA intervalComments/supporting evidenceSchmid, 2015; TE-LSM144HIV-HCV F0-4(F4 in 13%)10510/42 (24%) progressed by≥1 stageLSM increased by 3.4 kPa in progressors (vs. −0.15 in nonprogressors)3 yLSM detected rapid progression in 2 subjects.

In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.TE-LSM is the most studied imaging-based NILDA evaluated longitudinally at par with liver histology (Table 11). In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?Guideline Statements:In adults, TE-CAP has good diagnostic accuracy to grade steatosis and can be used in clinical practice. (ungraded statement)In adults, imaging-based NILDA, specifically TE-CAP and MRI-PDFF or MRS, are superior to blood-based NILDA tests and should be used in the assessment of hepatic steatosis where available. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSIn adult patients with CLD, MRI-PDFF and MRS have excellent correlation with histology for the detection and grading of steatosis and can be used as a reference standard and for following response to treatment.TE-CAP is a point-of-care test that can be used as the first-line screening tool for quantitative steatosis assessment. However, there are overlapping values to differentiate adjacent grades, and TE-CAP does not have sensitivity to assess changes with therapy.The optimal cutoff to maximize sensitivity for detecting at least grade 1 (≥5%) steatosis is 275 dB/m when using TE-CAP.The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.Conventional grayscale US can be used to screen for steatosis but is limited by operator dependence and lacks sensitivity and specificity for detection of steatosis. Furthermore, conventional US is unreliable for evaluating changes with therapy. However, steatosis quantification incorporated into conventional US machines is becoming more widely available.Noncontrast CT does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect mild degrees of steatosis and exposes patients to radiation. Thus, it is not recommended for assessing steatosis.MRI-PDFF has excellent diagnostic accuracy, better than that of grayscale US and TE-CAP, and can be used to assess changes with therapy and for clinical endpoints. However, MRI-PDFF may not widely available and is more expensive than TE-based assessment.The combination of blood- and imaging-based NILDA in algorithms to improve steatosis screening or diagnostic performance requires further study.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEMRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).TABLE 12 -Comparison of imaging techniques for hepatic steatosisaCriteriaGrayscale USCAPNoncontrast CTMRI-PDFFObjectiveYesYesYesYesSubjectiveYesNoNoNoQuantifiable (separation of steatosis grades)NoNoNoYesInterobserver reliabilityModerateModerateHighHighSensitive to change (with therapy)NoNoNoYesUsed in clinical trialsNoNoNoYesCostLowLowHighHighaModified from Siddiqui et al.247Abbreviations: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter; US, ultrasound.EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEGrayscale USThis is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.CTWith noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis.CAP measured with TEThis technique measures the attenuation of hepatic fat at the same time as it measures LSM.269–271Attenuation occurs as soundwaves lose energy as they travel through tissue.269,270Results range from 100 to 400 dB/m. CAP has very good interobserver reproducibility (concordance correlation coefficient 0.82 to 0.84)272,273but is influenced by BMI,272,274–277LSM,166,278and recent food ingestion252,279,280but not inflammation.281The failure rate is as high as 24% and is associated with increased BMI, age, female sex, and type of probe (M vs. XL).282–285Thresholds for grading steatosis vary and are dependent on the population studied57,257,286and the underlying liver disease and its fibrosis severity166,287; In addition, there can be overlap between adjacent grades269,277,288and discordant results in those with high CAP (>300 dB/m).289,290Although it has been suggested that the reliability of CAP is decreased when the IQR/median range is above 30 dB/m246to 40 dB/m,291,292excluding patients with IQR/median greater than these thresholds may not impact performance.275,278Table 13211,246,263,270,274–276,278,281,287,290–292,298–302,304–306,308–311,313,314shows the performance of CAP compared to liver histology or MRI-PDFF/MRS in CLD,263,300,308–310,314,355bariatric surgery,211,306,311deceased and living liver donors56,312,313and post-liver transplantation.87When the M and XL probes were compared in the same patient, the performance was similar in some studies using histology,302,304whereas the M probe underestimates CAP values when compared to the XL probe.246TABLE 13 -Performance of imaging tests for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosisReferencesTestSteatosis grade (by histology or MRI-PDFF)Cutoff (dB/m for CAP or % fat by MRI-PDFF)Sensitivity %Specificity %AUROCSasso269CAP≥11%a23891810.91≥34%a25989860.95≥66%a292100780.89Friedrich-Rust293CAP≥33%a24597670.78≥66%a30176680.72Kumar294CAP≥33%a25878730.79≥66%a28371680.77de Lédinghen277CAP≥33%a31079710.80≥66%a31187470.66Imajo109CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a23682910.88>33%a27078800.73>66%a30264740.70≥5%5.2%90930.96>33%11.3%79840.90>66%17.1%74810.79Park110CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26172860.85>33%b30563690.70>66%b31264700.73≥5%3.71961000.99>33%13.0380830.90>66%16.3782840.92Runge295CAPMR-PDFF≥5%a26090600.77>33%a29692550.78>66%a33478760.78≥5%4.14941000.98>33%15.7292970.97>66%20.88100830.95Chan283CAP≥5%a26091870.94>33%b26691870.80>66%b267100470.69Naveau296CAP≥5%b30868690.85>33%b33565790.56>66%b34174740.36Karlas297CAP>5%a21593870.93>33%a26897810.94>66%a30082760.82Myers287CAP>11%a28968880.73>33%a28885620.68>66%a28394470.52Sasso270CAP>11%a22276710.80>33%a23387740.86>66%a29078930.88Jung275CAP≥5%a25069930.86>33%a30182880.90>66%a32550810.74Shen274CAP≥5%a25389820.92>33%a28593830.92>66%a31092790.88Lupsor-Planton298CAP≥5%a26065870.81>33%a28570850.82>66%a29483820.84Wong291CAP≥5%a22287620.852906090Jun290CAP≥5%a24792860.90300511000.74Lee299CAP≥5%a247881000.95>33%a28085800.85>66%a30073610.73Chon276CAP≥5%a25073950.88>33%a29982860.89>66%a32779840.80Price300CAP≥5%a23884750.85Garg211CAP≥5%b32359830.75>33%b33674750.74>66%b357100780.82Andrade281CAP>5%a20682760.82>33%a23293840.96>66%a28295890.97Mendes292CAP>5%a24892830.86>33%a26881990.94>66%a28084990.96Darweesh301CAP>5%a29781730.77>33%a36685960.92Eddowes278CAP>5%ab30280830.87>33%ab33170760.77>66%ab33772630.70de Lédinghen302CAP>5%ab246/24275/7575/750.82/0.83>33%ab269/26780/8081/810.89/0.88>66%ab285/28681/8481/840.92/0.93Siddiqui303CAP≥5%a285c80770.76>33%b26390350.70>66%b35329900.58311c775728090353672090306c80402749020380390Chan304CAP≥5%ab253/27993/8371/880.84/0.91≥33%ab294/30385/7959/650.76/0.78≥66%ab294/32588/7636/540.61/0.65Caussy246CAP≥5%28875770.80≥10%30679820.87Xu305CAP≥5%a22469760.78≥33%a246100780.93≥66%a284100960.99Ooi306CAP≥33%a28585470.69Caussy307CAP≥5%a294/261/31675/90/5978/50/900.83≥5%b307/281/32373/90/6275/65/900.858≥10%a311//293/32679/90/5885/71/900.88≥10%b322/314/32383/90/8365/83/900.93Ferraioli263CAP≥5%a273c80830.85Petroff308CAPb≥5%294/263c/354c79/90/5274/50/900.81≥33%310/286c/372c79/90/2559/39/900.73≥66%331/297c/38572/90/2262/34/900.71Beyer309CAP≥5%269c891000.95≥33%308c78410.60≥66%337c61590.63Audière310CAP≥5%273c0.89Garteiser311CAP≥5%316c79840.83≥33%316c87610.79≥66%343c77640.73Yen312CAP10%-30%257c100890.96Zhuang313CAP≥5%270c100830.94Duarte-Rojo56CAP≥34%230c100530.79Siddiqui87CAP≥5%270c74870.88≥34%295c100890.94≥67%295c100840.89aM probe.bXL probe.cYouden’s index or equivalent optimal threshold.Abbreviation: CAP, controlled attenuation parameter.More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317PICO 7: In children with CLD (HCV, HIV-HCV, HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HBV, biliary atresia (BA), Alagille, alpha-1-antitrypsin (α1AT), cystic fibrosis liver disease, NASH/NAFLD), are imaging-based NILDA accurate in staging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis?Guidance Statement:In the pediatric population, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a single imaging-based NILDA over another to assess liver fibrosis or steatosis. (ungraded statement)TECHNICAL REMARKSThere are limited studies evaluating NILDA imaging tests as surrogates of liver fibrosis or steatosis with histologic confirmation in children with CLDs.There is high correlation of several US elastography-based platforms with histologically proven fibrosis in children.Different fasting and sedation requirements for each NILDA, as well as cooperation challenges and adherence to fasting protocols in younger children, can confound test results.Imaging-based NILDA have different disease-specific fibrosis staging thresholds than the adult population.Profound extrahepatic cholestasis that is unique to BA lessens accuracy of LSM to assess fibrosis.MRE and TE-based imaging are the most commonly used imaging NILDA to quantify liver steatosis in children with NASH and cystic fibrosis (CF).EVIDENCE AND RATIONALEImaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).TABLE 14 -Selected pediatric imaging NILDA studiesScroll left or right to view entire table.ReferencesImaging NILDAPediatric liver diseaseAUROC (sensitivity/specificity %) and correlation when availableCorrelation with fibrosis (r)Biopsy measureCommentsShin318VCTEBA (n=47)0.86 for F3(89.5%/75%)0.96 for F4(100%/90.5%)0.63METAVIR fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai hepatoportoenterostomyCutoff for F3: 9.6 kPaCutoff for F4: 18.1 kPaSuccess rate with the pediatric S probe (100%) vs M probe (77%;p<0.001)Hukkinen311VCTEBA (n=39)0.82 for F4(76%/75%)0.48METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F4: 23.8 kPaAUROC increased with ageGao320ARFIBA (n=50)0.82 for F≥2(91.4%/61.5%)0.88 for F≥3(94.7%/74.2%)0.92 for F=4(87.5%/90.5%)0.72Batts-Ludwig fibrosisAll were pre-Kasai.Cutoff for F≥2: 1.53 m/sCutoff for F≥3: 1.80 m/sCutoff for F=4: 2.16 m/sChen321SSWEBA (n=24)0.79 for F≥2(80%/73.7%)0.81 for F≥3(77.8%/80%)0.82 for F4(93.8%/87.5%)0.76METAVIR fibrosisAll were s/p KasaiCutoff for F2: 9.4 kPaCutoff for F3: 10.8 kPaCutoff for F4: 24.4 kPaLewindon322VCTECFLD (n=22)0.87 for F3-4(75%/100%)0.67METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3-4: 8.7 kPaGarcovich323SWENASH (n=68)0.92 for≥F1(85%/95%)0.97 for≥F2(87%/96%)0.84Brunt fibrosisBrunt classification (0-4)Cutoff for F≥1: 5.1 kPaCutoff for F≥2: 6.7 kPaMiddleton243MRI-PDFFNAFLD (n=83)0.87 for S1 vs S2-3(74%/90%)0.79 for s-2 vs S3(60%/90%)NASH CRNSteatosis (1-3)Cutoff for S2-3: 17.5%Cutoff for S3: 23.3%Schwimmer324MRENAFLD (n=90)0.77 for≥F1a(44.4%/90.7%)0.89 for≥F3a(33.3%/90.5%)0.53bNASH CRNFibrosis (0-4)Cutoff for≥F1: 2.78 kPa+Cutoff for≥F3: 3.33 kPa+Behairy325VCTEHCV (n=50)0.70 for≥F10.87 for≥F20.80 for≥F30.56Ishak fibrosisCutoffs not availableAwad327VCTEHCV (n=30)1.0 for F40.82 for F30.77METAVIR fibrosisCutoff for F3: 9.5 kPaCutoff for F4: 12.5 kPaaUsing automated reading.bMean of 3 centers.Abbreviations: CFLD, cystic fibrosis liver disease; CRN, clinical research network; HCV, hepatitis C; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; S, steatosis; TE, transient elastography.Biliary atresiaOne of the first studies using TE-LSM in infants with BA (n=47) found a significant positive correlation of LSM obtained with TE and fibrosis stage (ρ=0.63)318, with excellent to outstanding diagnostic performance: AUROCs were 0.86 and 0.96 for diagnosis of F3 and F4, respectively, with cutoffs of 9.6 kPa for F3 (sensitivity 89.5% and specificity 75%) and 18.1 kPa for F4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.5%). In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319In a study of 50 consecutive infants with BA and 50 healthy infants who underwent pSWE-LSM examination, in which all infants with BA underwent a liver biopsy within 3 days after imaging, the mean shear wave speed in the BA group was significantly higher than controls (1.89±0.45 versus 1.12±0.06 m/s;p<0.001).324A significant correlation was also found between the pSWE-LSM values and fibrosis stages (r=0.72). Notably, the cutoff values for predicting significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4) were 1.53 (AUROC 0.823), 1.80 (0.884), and 2.16 (0.917) m/s, respectively.Similarly, in a study using 2D-SWE-LSM in 24 children with BA (mean age 6.6 y) who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy within 1 week of liver biopsy, LSM was significantly higher in F3-4 versus F0-2 (23.5 kPa, IQR 6.7-10.7 vs. 7.5 kPa, IQR 12-40.3) and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fibrosis stage (r=0.762) with an AUROC of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.82 to predict F2, F3, and F4, respectively.321CF-related liver disease (CFLD)Several studies have examined the use of US-based elastography to detect liver fibrosis in patients with CF, but few have correlated imaging-based NILDA with histological fibrosis. A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity). The combination of TE-LSM with pSWE-LSM further improved the differentiation of patients with F3-4 fibrosis versus F1-2 fibrosis (AUROC, 0.92; 83% sensitivity; and 100% specificity;p<0.01).Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CFLD. Using TE-CAP, the relationship of CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors, and LSM was examined in a cross-sectional study of CF. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF and was not associated with increases in liver chemistries except for direct bilirubin.330Steatosis (CAP≥230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD without PHTN, and 20% in CFLD with PHTN (p<0.05 for comparison between CLFD without PHTN and the other 2 groups, and no significant difference between subjects without CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN). Although the authors concluded that CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, CAP was not validated with liver histology.NAFLD IN CHILDRENSteatosisEmerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity.FibrosisThe diagnostic accuracy of SWE-LSM in identifying different degrees of fibrosis in a cohort of consecutive children and adolescents with NASH has been less well studied. In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.A study of TE-LSM in 52 consecutively biopsied children with proven NASH (20 female) with a mean age of 13.6 years found that the AUROC for the prediction of F2-4 and F3-4 were 0.992 and 1, respectively.334TE-LSM values between 7 and 9 kPa predicted F1-2 but could not discriminate between stages (i.e., F2 or above). TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335MRE-LSM has also been used in children. In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM.Other CLD in childrenA limited number of imaging studies in children with other CLD have validated findings with liver histology, including HBV and HCV. Importantly, children with a variety of biologically distinct liver conditions have often been clustered into such analyses; one such study included 115 children (CF [n=42], viral infection [HBV or HCV, n=22], BA [n=13], Wilson’s disease [n=9], AIH [n=7], congenital hepatic fibrosis [n=4], and other [n=18]).336Of the 33 patients who underwent liver biopsy in this study, median values of LSM, FibroTest, and APRI demonstrated good correlation with METAVIR fibrosis stage, with highest values among children with F4. TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).A recent meta-analysis that included 723 children with various CLD who underwent TE-LSM demonstrated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of F2-4.327The diagnostic accuracies of TE-LSM were also clinically acceptable to excellent, measuring up to a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing cirrhosis, suggesting that TE-LSM is a reliable imaging NILDA of cirrhosis in children, although less so with earlier stages.A SIMPLIFIED NILDA ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION OF FIBROSIS AND STEATOSISIn an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology. The diagnosis of NAFLD or ALD mandates supporting clinical information and ruling out other causes of fatty liver disease. Abbreviations: AdvCLD, advanced chronic liver disease; CAP, ultrasound-based continuous attenuation parameter; CSPH, clinically significant portal hypertension; EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NFS, NAFLD fibrosis score; SWE, shear wave elastography; US, ultrasound. *Some ultrasound methods of fibrosis detection give results in m/s and need to be converted.Step 1: Determine the stage of fibrosisThe left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354Step 2: Determine the presence of steatosisMRI-PDFF has become the most accurate method and comparable to liver histology (AUROC 96%-99%).109,110With the integration of CAP in TE, a bedside steatosis assessment is now routinely available. Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONSImaging-based NILDA have replaced liver histology in clinical practice in many situations. Because of the rapid evolution of the field and predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria considered for our systematic reviews, we were not able to include every published study on the topic. In particular, studies with smaller sample size, those that did not have liver histology as the reference standard to assess fibrosis, and many studies with mixed etiologies or overlapping diseases were excluded.SUMMARY GUIDANCE STATEMENT OF IMAGING-BASED NILDARecognizing that liver histology is an imperfect reference standard, prior to considering a liver biopsy to assess fibrosis staging in patients with CLD, AASLD recommends using blood and imaging-based NILDA as the initial tests to detect significant (F2-4) to advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and cirrhosis (F4). (ungraded statement)FUTURE RESEARCHSubstantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations)."

      "Chronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with approximately two million annual deaths worldwide and is an enormous health burden.1,2The majority of liver-related outcomes, including liver failure, portal hypertension (PHTN) with its complications, and HCC, occur almost exclusively in those with advanced CLD. Therefore, early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. Although liver histology has long been the reference standard for assessing fibrosis and steatosis, it is costly, is invasive, and carries a small, but important, risk of complications.3,4Over the past few decades, multiple noninvasive blood biomarkers and imaging modalities or tests, here termed “NonInvasiveLiverDiseaseAssessment(s)” (NILDA), have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S).",

      "The guideline writing group consisted of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in both adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts. Two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions. The first approach depended on a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center that led to disease-specific graded recommendations (Supplemental Figure 1,https://links.lww.com/HEP/I346) following the guideline framework using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system approach (Table 2). These recommendations are followed by a section that describes the quality of evidence, when applicable, and other considerations. Strength of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, the burden of testing (access and financial), and feasibility of the recommended action. The “strength of recommendation” determination assumed that performing tests with excellent (>80%) or outstanding (>90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. The recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable).",

      "Fibrosis scores are generally disease-specific and technically cannot be unified across different CLD. To achieve a cohesive approach for the purposes of NILDA, this AASLD Guideline writing group incorporated the various fibrosis staging systems into a single one and classified them into at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to≥fibrosis stage 2, or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). For simplicity, the Guidelines statements use the generic “F” stages throughout the text. Various histologic scoring systems to stage fibrosis and grade inflammation and steatosis have been used as standard reference measures in studies validating NILDA biomarkers (Table 3A, B). For an in-depth discussion of the role and limitations of histopathology to stage fibrosis and steatosis in CLD, please refer to the blood-based NILDA guideline.6The reader is asked to critically consider the limitations in liver histology staging described herein because they could, in principle, make NILDA tools appear less accurate than they really are.22–26This methodological phenomenon further elevates the relevance of longitudinal validation of NILDA against clinical outcomes.25",

      "We used several statistical tests and indices in our assessment of the performance of imaging-based NILDA (Table 4). Although studies report test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity at a selected cutoff, these are dependent on disease prevalence.27The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) is the ratio of the odds of disease in those that test positive to the odds of the disease in those that test negative and provides a reliable estimate of a test’s accuracy that is relatively independent from the prevalence of the condition being tested. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis is another effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. The AUROC has a range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates a perfectly inaccurate test and a value of 1 reflects a perfectly accurate test. In general, an AUROC of 0.5-0.69 suggests no to poor discrimination, 0.7-0.79 is acceptable, 0.8-0.89 is excellent, and 0.9 or more is outstanding.28",

      "Transient elastography (TE, or vibration-controlled TE) uses M-mode US to track the speed of propagation of a mild amplitude and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic wave produced by a mechanical vibrator included in the probe. The liver shear wave speed is expressed as the elastic modulus or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) within a range of 2.5-75 kPa. The faster the shear wave propagates through the liver, the higher the LSM, indirectly indicating a greater degree of fibrosis. The total area of tissue that is evaluated with this technique is approximately 3 cm3, corresponding to a liver volume at least 100 times larger than a standard liver biopsy specimen. At least 10 valid measurements with an interquartile range (IQR)<30% of the median value is required for reliable results.30Two probes have been developed for adults (M and XL probe), along with one for pediatric use (S probe, which has two settings, S1 and S2, based on thoracic circumference of<45 cm and 45-75 cm, respectively).31–33The M probe is designed to assess patients with a skin-to-(liver) capsule distance (SCD)<25 mm, and it quantifies stiffness at a distance of 25-65 mm from the skin, whereas the XL probe quantifies stiffness at depths of 35-75 mm from the skin. The XL probe in patients with obesity is successful in LSM in over 95% of patients with body mass index (BMI)≥40 kg/m2. A more recent study, however, suggested obtaining LSM with the XL probe in all patients with a BMI≥32 kg/m2, given the high frequency (78%) of SCD≥25 mm in this group.32Of note, the XL probe yields lower LSM values than the M probe when tested on the same patient, although no adjustment in the cutoff values has been recommended given that TE yields higher LSM values in patients with obesity for whom the XL probe is normally used, thus potentially counterbalancing any between-probe differences.31,34,35TE is unreliable in the presence of ascites and is confounded by other factors (Table 6Aand6B).",

      "Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) techniques assess liver stiffness based on tissue displacement from acoustic compression pulses.58The regions of interest (ROIs) are selected with real-time grayscale US imaging and are not limited to the right intercostal area. ARFI encompasses two related techniques: point shear wave elastography (pSWE), which assesses ROIs measuring 10×5 mm2, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), which interrogates more than one ROI in rapid succession to decrease sampling error. The 2D-SWE assesses a larger field of analysis than TE-LSM and pSWE because the size of the ROI can be modified by the operator. The recommended depth to locate the ROIs is 4-8 cm from transducer surface for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, and results are expressed in m/s with a range of 0.5-4.459or kPa with ranges as high as 300, depending on the manufacturer.58",
      "Conceptually, pSWE and 2D-SWE are similar to TE, with reliable performance standards including an acquisition success rate≥60% (ratio of valid/total acquisitions) and an IQR of 30% or less of the median value. The major difference is the method for generating the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness estimation), as TE uses vibration to generate a propagation shear wave, whereas ARFI relies on the shear waves generated during tissue absorption of an acoustic pulse. As a result, ARFI results are less affected by ascites or obesity because the shear waves are generated inside the liver.36,60The ROIs for the 2D-SWE and pSWE are much larger than that from TE, and ROIs can be moved to avoid interrogating regions with large vessels or masses. A limitation of shear wave elastography (SWE) is the need for technical expertise, including proper selection of ROI within the liver parenchyma (i.e., right lobe, at proper depth, in an area devoid of vascular/biliary structures and without exerting mechanical tissue compression). pSWE/2D-SWE are affected by many similar factors as TE (Table 6A). Finally, liver stiffness cutoff values for pSWE and 2D-SWE are unique to each vendor-specific machine and must be interpreted accordingly. Although TE may not provide as much anatomic information as pSWE and 2D-SWE, it offers a standardized platform to allow for more uniform thresholds for varying levels of fibrosis."

      "Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) uses propagating mechanical shear waves generated with an acoustic passive plastic driver placed over the right upper quadrant. Similar to US-based techniques, the speed of propagation of the shear wave determines tissue stiffness. An advantage of MRE is that it interrogates almost the entire liver and, thus, allows for more complete assessment than the US-based elastography methods. Total acquisition time using a standard 2D Gradient Recalled Echo (2D GRE) sequence is approximately 40-60 seconds, adding minimal time to a standard abdominal MRI exam.61Other sequences such as 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) are up to 4 times faster.62ROIs with an adequate wave amplitude are selected to quantify the elastic modulus, expressed in a range of 0-20 kPa.63Newer methods provide automatic LSM without user interaction. Ascites and, rarely, obesity can limit MRE performance by interfering with shear wave propagation, but more importantly, hepatic iron overload generates an inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., liver R2* >76 s-1 at 1.5T), which can result in MRE failure when using 2D GRE, particularly at 3T.40,64New EPI sequences are more immune to susceptibility artifacts from iron deposition.62Although there are no large comparative studies assessing failure to obtain LSM across imaging-based NILDA, the rate of failed MRE testing is generally lower than that of US-based techniques.37,65,66Similar to US-based elastography, MRE has several factors that can confound results or limit their use (Table 6A).",

Although this is an important change that will impact of future of the study of this entity, all data utilized to develop these guideline statements were based on prior literature that utilized the previous NAFLD definition. Therefore, NAFLD is the term used throughout this document when referring to the existing literature. Current evidence indicates >98% overlap between patients who meet criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and the new criteria for MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in large cohort studies, indicating that the analyses and recommendations provided in these Guidelines for patients with NAFLD/NASH are likely to pertain to patients characterized by the new nomenclature of MASLD and MASH."

However, TE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM showed broader confidence intervals than in other CLD, which reached the poor discriminative performance range.67Other meta-analyses have found equivalent accuracy for pSWE-LSM (AUROC=0.86), 2D-SWE-LSM (AUROC=0.85), and TE-LSM (AUROC=0.85) to detect significant fibrosis.60,75For advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, US-based methods also performed in the acceptable to excellent range, although with some improvement in accuracy when compared to significant fibrosis, particularly for TE-LSM.67Various meta-analyses have found AUROC, sensitivities, and specificities in the 0.80-1.0 range for all US-based methods when estimating either advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.60,76,77Using dual cutoff values, a methodology not included in our formal analysis, a recent study examining 1765 patients included in clinical trials proposed TE-LSM cutoff values of<9.9 kPa to rule out (sensitivity 83%, specificity 61%) and≥11.4 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%).78In clinical practice, TE-LSM<8 kPa are used to rule out advanced fibrosis whereas TE-LSM >12 kPa is used to rule it in.79In our systematic review, MRE-LSM had sensitivities and specificities in the excellent to outstanding range, which were higher than any other method67and similar in performance to that in a recent meta-analysis including 910 patients with NAFLD (AUROC=0.93, 0.93, and 0.95 for F2-4, F3-4, and F4, respectively).80",

A meta-analysis assessing TE-LSM in 834 patients with ALD found sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 70% for F3-4 and 95% and 71% for cirrhosis, respectively.81This study proposed a TE-LSM cutoff value of 12.5 kPa for cirrhosis, which contrasts the cutoff values we identified (from 15-18 kPa) that portend a higher specificity. A recent meta-analysis also favored a higher cutoff value of 18.6 kPa which resulted in an 85% specificity for cirrhosis, which is likely more useful in ruling in this degree of fibrosis.80",

In PBC, we identified at least one study for each of the studied techniques. US-based techniques showed sensitivities of 67%-100% which improved along with higher stages of fibrosis while associated with varying specificities in the 77%-100% range.67Using a dual cutoff approach (LSM ≤6.5 and >11 kPa) in 167 patients with PBC, the AUROC was 0.89 for F3-4 with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%, independent of the liver chemistries or BMI.84The high specificity cutoff value in this study was similar to that identified in our systematic review.85Interestingly, the accuracy of MRE-LSM was numerically inferior to that from US-based LSM, particularly with respect to sensitivity (range of 51-70%).67Our systematic review identified two PSC studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria (with acceptable to outstanding performance) across all fibrosis stages.67In clinical practice, TE-LSM thresholds of 9.6 and 14.4 kPa are used to detect F3 and F4, respectively.86",

      "Given the limited availability and recent clinical use of MRE-LSM, less published data comparing MRE-LSM and TE-LSM/ARFI-LSM methods are available. Pooled analysis from 3 NAFLD studies109–111showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRE-LSM compared to TE-LSM for each stage of fibrosis,112and a clear trend was observed in another two studies for F3-4.106,113A meta-analysis in NAFLD populations showed that MRE-LSM and SWE-LSM had the highest AUROCs for significant fibrosis and advanced fibrosis compared to TE.77Similar diagnostic accuracy between MRE-LSM and 2D-SWE-LSM for F2-4 and F3-4 was reported in another study.106Other studies have found MRE-LSM to be superior114–116or equivalent117to TE-LSM in mixed etiology cohorts. MRE-LSM was found to be equivalent to 2D-SWE-LSM in a mixed etiology cohort,118whereas a study in NAFLD found that MRE-LSM outperformed pSWE-LSM, especially in patients with obesity.119",

The performance of these have been evaluated as either synchronous (paired application of tests) or sequential (second test following an inconclusive initial test) approaches (Table 10A-C).

      "An early study assessed a synchronous combination of TE-LSM with FibroTest in 183 patients with HCV. Compared to TE-LSM alone, synchronous TE-LSM+FibroTest had a higher AUROC for significant and advanced fibrosis but not for cirrhosis.172This combination was subsequently compared to a sequential APRI and FibroTest blood-marker algorithm (sequential algorithm for fibrosis evaluation [SAFE]) in patients with HCV. For significant fibrosis, the accuracy of TE-LSM+FibroTest was lower than SAFE, but it was estimated that fewer liver biopsies would be required to assess discordant cases with the former. For cirrhosis, the accuracy for combined TE-LSM+FibroTest was higher than SAFE, but there was no effect on the need for liver biopsy.188Both algorithms were evaluated in independent HCV cohorts; one study confirmed prior observations of lower diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis and fewer required biopsies for TE-LSM+FibroTest compared to SAFE. For F4, the TE-LSM+FibroTest combination had a higher diagnostic accuracy than SAFE, but in contrast to prior observations, this approach required a higher rate of liver biopsy.189Compared to TE-LSM alone, a synchronous classification with FibroMeter+TE-LSM had increased accuracy for F2-4 and F3-4 but not F4.173Overall accuracy for FibroMeter with TE-LSM was comparable to TE-LSM+FibroTest and able to eliminate biopsy for a diagnosis including six classes of fibrosis.189Another study noted that synchronous combinations of blood markers, such as FibroTest, FibroMeter, or HepaScore, and TE-LSM were able to improve accuracy and reduce need for biopsy for significant fibrosis but not cirrhosis.141Other studies with mixed liver disease cohorts have indicated an incremental benefit in diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis178and cirrhosis179in patients with HCV using combined TE-LSM and FibroMeter.",
      "A study in 156 patients with HBV, using different LSM thresholds for normal or elevated ALT, indicated that a sequential TE-LSM and Forns Index algorithm was able to improve confirmatory diagnosis for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone.180A subsequent study of 85 patients with HBV confirmed that the performance for a sequential TE and ELF algorithm for advanced fibrosis was comparable to TE-LSM alone.181Another study of 81 patients compared synchronous Forns Index with ARFI or TE-LSM and noted a higher accuracy for significant fibrosis with ARFI+Forns Index compared to TE-LSM+Forns Index, but comparisons with single tests were not provided.96A study in 92 patients with HBV, using an integrated analysis that combined ARFI, TE-LSM, and APRI into a linear algorithm noted no differences in AUROCs for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as compared to single tests.98In another study, a synchronous combination of 5 blood biomarkers (hyaluronic acid, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type III, type IV collagen, ALT, and AST) and TE-LSM had a similar AUROC compared to TE alone for significant fibrosis.190Another study in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis B evaluated the synchronous combination of ARFI+APRI+FIB-4 but did not improve sensitivity and specificity compared to newly derived upper and lower thresholds for individual tests.145In a single center study of 222 patients with HBV, the sequential TE-LSM and ELF algorithm was more accurate than synchronous TE-LSM+ELF in detecting advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but comparisons to single tests were not provided.174",
      "For patients coinfected with HBV/HIV on stable antiretroviral therapy, sequential combinations of TE and FibroTest more accurately detected significant and advanced fibrosis than single tests.175The addition of APRI or FIB-4 did not improve diagnostic accuracy or reduce misclassification rates for advanced fibrosis compared to TE-LSM alone for these patients who are coinfected.165No studies were identified that evaluated combination algorithms to assess changes in fibrosis on histology, either as part of the natural history of HBV or secondary to antiviral therapy."

      "A study in 321 patients with NAFLD showed that synchronous TE-LSM+NFS provided the best diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis but increased the diagnostic “gray zone” to 48%, yielding a correct fibrosis classification in just over one-half of patients.182Another study noted high NPV for significant and advanced fibrosis using TE-LSM alone; however, PPV improved when using the combined TE-LSM+Fibrometer algorithm as a sequential second-line test in patients with LSM above a designated threshold.176A cohort study of 761 patients from 3 centers in Europe and Asia compared various synchronous and sequential combinations of TE-LSM, NFS, and FIB-4 for advanced fibrosis. Paired combinations had lower accuracy and uncertainty for advanced fibrosis in over one-half of patients. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or using these simple blood-based markers following TE >7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%. This approach reduced uncertainty to 20% with 9-11% misclassified.158",
      "Clinical trials in NAFLD continue to provide important data regarding noninvasive tests for advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of combined TE-LSM with ELF, FIB-4, or NFS for advanced fibrosis was evaluated in a large multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3-4). Synchronous combinations of TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced the misclassification rates to<5% but increased the indeterminate classification for nearly two-thirds of patients. Sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range classification to 20% but increased the proportion misclassified to 20% in this high advanced fibrosis prevalence cohort.78Another cohort study of 938 patients from 4 centers in France determined that combining either FIB-4 or NFS with sequential TE-LSM increased the accuracy for advanced fibrosis.183Other studies from Asian cohorts found that synchronous or sequential strategies (ELF or FIB-4 followed by TE-LSM) did not improve diagnostic accuracy (0.75-0.79) for advanced fibrosis over single tests (0.74-0.78).185Conversely, another study combining TE and blood-based markers into a regression index increased diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis.184A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; for steatosis), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at≥0.9 has been proposed to identify patents with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS≥4), and≥F2. However, 30-39% of patients were still classified as indeterminate.191More recently, a study of 577 subjects with suspected NASH compared combination FIB-4 with TE-LSM and/or 2D-SWE-LSM and observed that combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) in a two-step process performed better than either test alone. When all three tests were combined, the performance remained high (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%) and reduced the need for liver biopsy to 7.3%.192Finally, a recent cost-effectiveness analysis assessed FIB-4 followed by either LSM (by either TE or MRE) or initially performing liver biopsy to detect cirrhosis. FIB-4+TE-LSM was the least costly strategy, followed by FIB-4+MRE-LSM, with FIB-4+liver biopsy being the most expensive.193In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4≥1.3 is recommended.79"

      "Multiple studies have assessed changes in liver fibrosis by means of serial biopsy, showing fibrosis regression194–197in viral hepatitis, regression/progression in NASH,198,199and progression in PBC.200Although imaging-based NILDA has opened the possibility of studying fibrosis trajectory without liver histology,201there is paucity of evidence to fully endorse this approach. Most published studies did not perform paired liver biopsies along with NILDA or did not have a baseline NILDA for comparison. Rather, conclusions were reached after contrasting observed against expected results (i.e., baseline histology vs. follow-up elastography) or by including indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis (i.e., changes in PHTN manifestations).202,203Even though such reports are valuable, they have inherent biases, as imaging-based NILDA is affected by factors other than fibrosis (Table 6A). As such, the Writing Group agreed to emphasize studies with scientific rigor, including concomitant NILDA and liver histology at baseline and follow-up (Table 11).",

      "Rapid LSM changes are common in patients with chronic HBV during a flare48or in ALD with alcohol-induced hepatitis.44,82In HCV, viral eradication is followed by an abrupt, substantial decrease in LSM (up to 15 kPa following DAA).219,220Rather than reflecting fibrosis regression, rapid changes likely reflect reduced inflammation as they parallel ALT/AST decrease74,82; similar rapid changes have been described for blood-based NILDA.221,222It remains unclear to what degree improved inflammation contributes to decreased stiffness following successful treatment in HCV or HBV.223–225Hence, when aiming to stage fibrosis in viral hepatitis, NILDA values obtained prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy are considered reflective of fibrosis. In fact, most of the LSM cutoff values that have been reported to detect cirrhosis or predict clinical outcomes were identified in patients who were viremic, although the field is rapidly evolving. As such, until the inflammatory component—or bile duct obstruction in cholestatic liver disease—can be separated from the changes in stiffness that are exclusively related to improving/worsening fibrosis, the imaging NILDA trajectory should be used to support regression or progression of fibrosis but not as conclusive evidence.",

In HCV-HIV, TE-LSM increased in the subset of patients with progressive fibrosis,144whereas in an HCV cohort there was a remarkable reduction in serial 6-monthly TE-LSM after up to 5.5 years of sustained virologic response (SVR).204In 12 of 15 patients who underwent post-SVR liver biopsies, a decrease in liver fibrosis was confirmed by histopathology. Interestingly, improved LSM correlated better with the collagen proportional area than with routine histologic staging, likely in relation to the location of “persistent post-SVR fibrosis,” which is sinusoidal and not accounted for in typical staging systems.204Evidence in treated HBV shows an initial substantial decline in TE-LSM that is likely due to resolved inflammation, whereas a more gradual and sustained decline occurs after the first year of treatment, likely corresponding to improved fibrosis,206although there are conflicting data.226In NAFLD, patients without LSM-based regression or with F3-4 progression had the highest risk for adverse outcomes, further substantiating the clinical usefulness of changes in imaging-based NILDA,210and there is evidence of changes in LSM better correlating with fibrosis trajectory than with inflammation/steatosis.212After bariatric surgery, studies confirmed regression of fibrosis in almost half of patients along with a concomitant drop in TE-LSM.211",
      "Given historical evidence of regression of cirrhosis (20-60% of post-SVR HCV and 40-100% of post-treatment HBV), repeat imaging-based NILDA provide indirect evidence of regression of fibrosis even in the absence of concomitant histology.227–229In TE-based studies without baseline histology (Table 11), one showed decreased fibrosis staging on the basis of LSM among patients with HCV after 2 years of follow-up.214In cases without follow-up histology, a decrease in LSM was observed among patients with HCV or HBV with a positive antiviral response after 1 to 3 years but not among patients with ongoing viremia.208,215–217In a cohort of patients with HCV, a decrease of >1 kPa/year was associated with improved survival.230In a study reporting long-term follow-up imaging-based NILDA only (i.e., no baseline NILDA) for patients with HCV with known F3-4 staging at baseline, those who experienced fibrosis regression on paired liver biopsies had remarkably lower LSM values, whereas almost all with persistent histological cirrhosis had TE-LSM≥12 kPa.218",
      "Serial TE in 150 patients with PBC followed for up to 5 years showed that an increase in LSM over time was a predictor of clinical outcomes.170In a study of 130 patients with PSC, there was an average increase of 3.9±2.1 kPa/year between the first and last TE-LSM, and the change in LSM along with total bilirubin were the only variables linked to clinical outcomes.169The study also showed that patients exhibiting a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid had an attenuated LSM rise versus nonresponder.169Because the noninvasive assessment was useful in predicting adverse events, including mortality, these data serve as indirect NILDA validation for determining progressive disease in PBC and PSC.",
      "Data on SWE-LSM and MRE-LSM to follow fibrosis are limited. Following DAA-SVR in HCV, median LSM by MRE decreased from 4.2 to 3.3 kPa in 308 patients, and it decreased by 20% or more in almost half of them.231Two studies in patients with NASH plus paired biopsy showed conflicting results for MRE-LSM. The first was based on a clinical trial and found acceptable performance for detecting regression but poor discrimination for progressive fibrosis,213whereas the second (untreated patients) showed that an increase by≥15% in MRE-LSM reflected progression from early to advanced fibrosis with no association with regression232(Table 11). These results highlight the need to consider confounding factors such as CLD pharmacological/lifestyle interventions potentially affecting inflammation/steatosis when interpreting changes in sequential imaging-based NILDA. Newer technologies better correlating with histologic steatohepatitis, such as 3D MRE, would be of help to disentangle regression/progression of fibrosis from its confounders.233",
      "PICO 6: In adult patients with NAFLD, are imaging tests such as US, CT, and TE-CAP accurate in grading hepatic steatosis (using histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS], or MRI-proton density fat fraction [PDFF] as the reference)?",

      "MRS accurately quantifies lipid fraction relative to water in the liver and is accepted as a reference standard for the assessment of hepatic steatosis.234,235Similarly, MRI-PDFF has shown excellent correlation with MRS236–238and liver histology112,239–241and can be used to assess the entire liver. Thus, these two MR techniques are NILDA but can also act as reference standards in the quantification of hepatic steatosis. These imaging tests have advantages compared to histology in that they are noninvasive, can assess larger amounts of liver while avoiding regions of focal fatty deposition, and avoid issues of intra- and interobserver variability associated with histologic assessment.242,243MRI-PDFF can be used to assess clinical outcomes in phase IIa clinical trials.244Studies have shown it is superior to CAP.109,110,112,245Unlike CAP, it is unaffected by BMI246(as long as the patient can fit in the magnet) or fibrosis. Using multipeak modeling with T2 correction, MRI-PDFF had 100% sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC for detecting at least 5.56% steatosis.237It has also been used to assess changes with therapy247–250and eligibility for living liver donation.251",
      "However, MR is relatively expensive and is not universally available. Thus, less expensive and more available assessments are needed. Conventional imaging with US, CT, and MRI can assess for fatty liver with variable accuracy, particularly at low levels of fat, and cannot be used to follow steatosis after treatment. US-based quantification is now available with TE-CAP, and similar assessments are becoming available on newer conventional US machines. Thus, imaging tests to assess the severity of steatosis can be divided into US- or MRI-based techniques244(Table 12).",

      "This is the most common technique used to assess steatosis because of wide availability and the morphologic assessment that is helpful when patients present with abnormal liver tests. Features on US suggestive of steatosis include liver hyperechogenicity as compared to the kidneys, distal attenuation of vessels, and classic areas of focal fatty sparing.252–254However, conventional grayscale US has limitations, including operator dependency, lower accuracy in obesity and in those with renal dysfunction, and its qualitative rather than quantitative assessment.255,256Furthermore, it cannot accurately detect<20% and therefore is not useful for those without significant steatosis.257A recent meta-analysis of conventional US identified 49 studies that included 4720 participants.254The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) to detect at least 20%-30% steatosis compared to liver histology were 84.8% (95% CI, 79.5-88.9), 93.6% (95% CI, 87.2-97.0), 13.3 (95% CI, 6.4-27.6), and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22), respectively. The AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI, 91-95), whereas the reproducibility (kappa) ranged from 0.54-0.92 and 0.44-1.00 for intrarater and interrater assessments, respectively. The authors concluded that because of the low cost, safety, and accessibility, conventional US was reliable and accurate for detection of moderate to severe steatosis in the general population. Based on these observations, European guidelines recommend grayscale US as an initial imaging choice to identify steatosis.258However, this approach lacks sensitivity to detect lesser amounts of steatosis (<20%) and is not useful to follow changes in steatosis over time.",
      "Newer quantitative assessments of attenuation and backscatter steatosis have been incorporated into conventional US machines for use in quantifying steatosis259–264in a manner similar to that of TE-CAP. These systems allow for selection of larger ROIs than TE-CAP. Vessels and strong artifacts can be automatically filtered out. Although these results are promising and many showed statistically better performance than for TE-CAP, the amount of data for these different systems are limited. Because the quantitative reporting of fat using these machines is relatively new to widespread clinical use, further studies are needed to assess which systems work best and how to implement these systems in a more standardized manner across different conventional US platforms.",
      "With noncontrast CT, hepatic steatosis can be diagnosed if the attenuation of the liver is at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) lower than that of the spleen, the liver/spleen HU ratio is ≤0.8, or the attenuation of the liver is<40 HU.252,265–268However, because of concerns for radiation exposure and inability to detect mild steatosis, CT is not used for a primary indication of assessment of steatosis. Nevertheless, if a noncontrast CT is performed for other indications, it can be used to diagnose moderate to severe steatosis."

      "More recently, a method to optimize cutoffs to improve accuracy is to set both the sensitivity and specificity at 90%, respectively, thus allowing one to balance both these performance metrics. By setting the sensitivity to 90%, the cutoffs had high PPV (96%) and the chance of false negative results (NPV 15%) and missing steatosis was minimized.278,315Several studies applying this analysis method identified CAP thresholds of 263-285 dB/m for detecting≥5% steatosis (Table 13). Until a meta-analysis combining these data is performed, the writing group suggests a threshold of 275 dB/m across various CLD etiologies. Interpretation of CAP needs to consider the type of probe used, the fasting state, the level of stiffness, whether high sensitivity or specificity is desired, and the IQR/median range.166,316Nevertheless, CAP is superior to blood-based algorithms.276,305,307CAP has also been used to assess changes with therapy. In a study of 65 patients, a change of at least 35 dB/m was highly associated with improvements in steatosis.317",

      "Imaging-based NILDA in children and adolescents remain an understudied field, though there has recently been an increase of pediatric histology-validated studies using primarily US-based elastography243,318–326(Table 14). In adults, NAFLD-associated fibrosis is typically centrilobular, and other CLDs are typically portal-based. In children, fibrosis is often triggered by a genetic or persistent environmental insult or by biliary injury; thus, patterns of fibrosis distribution depend on the etiology and response to injury. A cohort analysis of 154 children and young adults (ages 3 wk to 24 y) with a spectrum of CLD328concluded that with more advanced fibrosis, inflammation did not appear to contribute to LSM, lending caution to interpreting LSM in children with substantial hepatic inflammation. The role of elastography is confounded in children with edema, extrahepatic cholestasis, and venous congestion, which can increase LSM independent of fibrosis.329This study also highlighted that the wide spectrum of liver diseases in children likely have distinct thresholds for fibrosis severity and that elastography has difficulty differentiating between individual stages of fibrosis in children, particularly at early stages (F1 and F2).",

In a different study investigating markers for histologic liver fibrosis after successful hepatoportoenterostomy (defined as total bilirubin less than 20 μM/L) with protocol liver biopsies (n=83) in 39 children with BA, TE-LSM was the most accurate predictor of cirrhosis (F4) (AUROC 0.82;p<0.001) compared with liver biochemistries and APRI.319",

A cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy of TE-LSM in 160 consecutive children who presented with CF (9.0±0.4 y old, 53% male) at a tertiary referral pediatric center in Australia found that LSM correlated positively with fibrosis stage in patients with histology-proven CFLD (r=0.67).322Fibrosis severity was determined from histologic analysis of dual-pass liver biopsies from children with CFLD as the reference standard. A TE-LSM cutoff value of 8.7 kPa differentiated patients with F3-4 from patients with F1-2 (AUROC, 0.87; 75% sensitivity; 100% specificity).

      "Emerging data studying MRI as a surrogate marker of steatosis in children have been encouraging but has not been adequately validated with liver histology. In one study, liver MRI-PDFF estimated by MRI was strongly correlated (r=0.725) with steatosis grade by liver histology.331The study included 174 children with a mean age of 14 years. The correlation was stronger in girls (r=0.86) than in boys (r=0.70,p<0.01). Interestingly, the correlation was significantly weaker in children with stages F2-4 (r=0.61) than children with no fibrosis (r=0.76) or stage F1 (r=0.78). The diagnostic accuracy of commonly used threshold values to distinguish between no steatosis and mild steatosis ranged from 0.69 to 0.82. The overall accuracy of predicting the histologic steatosis grade from MRI-PDFF was 56%. No single threshold had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered diagnostic for an individual child. However, a prospective, cross-sectional study of 77 patients with NAFLD and liver histology, of whom 65 were children, demonstrated good correlation of MRI-PDFF with histologic steatosis grade (ρ=0.69,p<0.001).239The AUROC was 0.99 for distinguishing patients with steatosis grade 0 from those with≥grade 1, 0.83 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 1 from those with≥grade 2, and 0.89 to distinguish those with ≤ grade 2 from those with grade 3. In a study of MRI-PDFF in children with NAFLD who stratified steatosis grade before and after treatment with cysteamine bitartrate, 110 (65%) and 83 (49%) enrolled children had MRI and liver histology at baseline and at the end of treatment (52 wk), respectively.243MRI-PDFF classified grade S1 versus S2-3 and grades S1-2 versus S3 with AUROCs of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. MRI-PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At end of treatment, MRI-PDFF change classified steatosis grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.87) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), respectively. MRI-PDFF change cutoff values at 90% specificity were −11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. In this study, MRI-PDFF had high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with NAFLD.",
      "In the only pediatric study of TE-CAP correlation with steatosis in 69 children with a mean age of 16 years (38% female) who had a liver histology within 1.3 months, there were significant differences between CAP values in children with no steatosis versus mild/moderate steatosis (p<0.0001), no steatosis versus marked steatosis (p<0.0001), and mild/moderate versus marked steatosis (p=0.004).332Children with no steatosis had mean CAP of 198, whereas children with mild/moderate and marked steatosis had mean CAP values of 265 and 313, respectively. A CAP threshold of 225 dB/m for predicting steatosis demonstrated an AUROC of 0.93 with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity."

In a cohort of children with histology-proven NASH (37 boys and 31 girls; mean age 12.6 y±2.5; age range 8-17 y), SWE-LSM was performed in 68 of 69 patients and showed a strong correlation with liver fibrosis stage (r=0.84).323The AUROCs for the association of any (F1-4) and significant fibrosis (F2-4) were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97). In another prospective study of 67 consecutive adolescents with histology-proven NAFLD, liver stiffness measured by time-harmonic elastography demonstrated an AUROC for the detection of any fibrosis (≥stage F1), moderate fibrosis (≥stage F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥stage F3) of 0.88, 0.99, and 0.88, respectively.333Based on Youden’s index, the optimal liver stiffness thresholds were 1.52 m/s for≥F1, 1.62 m/s for≥F2, and 1.64 m/s for≥F3.",

TE-LSM values of≥9 kPa were associated with F3-4 with an intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute agreement of 0.961. Similarly, using the NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging, another pediatric cohort of 67 children with histology-proven NAFLD had TE performed and demonstrated an AUROC of 1 using an LSM score of≥8.6 kPa to detect F2-4.335",

In a case series of 35 children and adolescents with a median age of 13 years (49% female) and BMI of 33.9 kg/m2, this histology-validated study proposed a cutoff of 2.71 kPa based on an AUROC of 0.92 with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting significant fibrosis (>F2). In a prospective multicenter study of MRE in 90 children with NAFLD (mean age 13.1±2.4 y), the median LSM was 2.35 kPa.331Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r=0.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, ρ=0.53; center 2, ρ=0.55; and using an automated analysis, ρ=0.52). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72% (95% CI, 62-81). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 89% (95% CI, 81-95) for center 1, 90% (95% CI, 82-95) for center 2, and 87% (95% CI, 78-93) for an automated analysis, suggesting clinical utility of MRE-LSM."

TE-LSM significantly correlated with METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.53) and the AUROC of LSM to detect cirrhosis was 0.88. Unfortunately, only 2 patients with viral hepatitis had biopsies; thus, these data may not be generalizable to other children.",
      "In a study of 90 children (n=50 HCV, n=20 AIH, n=20 Wilson’s disease) who underwent TE-LSM, the majority of the HCV group had minimal inflammatory activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). LSM values for the same stage of fibrosis varied by disease, highlighting biological differences, but correlated well among children with HCV (r=0.885).325Furthermore, the AUROC of LSM to detect F1-4, F2-4, and F3-4 among the pediatric HCV group was 0.70, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively, although no specific cutoffs were provided.",
      "In an Egyptian study of 30 children with chronic HCV who had liver histology, there was a strong positive correlation between TE-LSM and METAVIR fibrosis stages (r=0.774).326The highest predictive performance of LSM was for F4 (AUROC 1.0) followed by F3-4 (0.82) using cutoff values of 12.5 and 9.5 kPa, respectively. The NPV to exclude F3-4 and F4 at these cutoffs were high (100%), whereas PPV were only modest (60%-83%).",

      "In an effort to facilitate incorporation of NILDA into clinical practice for adults, the AASLD NILDA Writing Group developed an algorithm intended to be used by clinicians in need of a readily available and simple decision support tool (Figure 2A). There were insufficient data for a pediatric algorithm. This adult algorithm was developed with summary NILDA evidence highlighted previously. The fibrosis staging algorithm can start at either blood- or imaging-based NILDA and does not imply the use of sequential testing. However, sequential testing has been found to be more informative than single testing and could be considered.337,338The AASLD NILDA Writing Group decided to move away from etiology-specific individualized cutoff values and rather endorse similar cutoff values across liver diseases to favor NILDA implementation.339–341Non-disease-specific cutoff values are expected to improve access to early hepatology referral and continued hepatology care as well as the rate of screening for complications. Whenever more granularity is needed (i.e., start of antiviral treatment for a patient with HBV and significant fibrosis), clinicians should refer to the associated NILDA Systematic Reviews67,68,342or specific guidance documents.7,79The thresholds are poorly defined in those with treated viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative).",
      "FIGURE 2:Simplified NILDA algorithm for the clinician. AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD because of their wide availability and performance compared to proprietary tests, though these can be used where available. NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for assessment of advanced fibrosis. Although imaging-based LSM-NILDA (TE and SWE) are more accurate than blood-based in some situations, they are not as not widely available. Being the most accurate method, MRE is highly attractive, but due to the lack of a robust evidence base, LSM cutoff values suggested herein might need to be revised as new evidence in the field is made available. For viral hepatitis, it is important to note that the majority of data in both imaging and blood-based NILDA have been studied in viremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA positive) subjects. Therefore, the simplified algorithm is not intended for use in patients who are nonviremic (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative). The degree of steatosis decreases and may even disappear as fibrosis progresses, and as such, the lack of steatosis in a patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.

      "The left side of the algorithm aims to rule out significant/advanced fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS showed sensitivities ranging from 60% to 75% and the lowest negative LR at proposed cutoff values across etiologies.68Regarding imaging-based testing, a recent study including >16,000 individuals revealed normal TE-LSM to be below 5 kPa, with the consideration that obesity, steatosis, and diabetes mellitus can increase LSM.339,343As such, significant/advanced fibrosis can be confidently ruled out with a TE/SWE-LSM<5 kPa (or MRE-LSM<2.5 kPa). However, with TE/SWE-LSM≥5 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥2.5 kPa) in a patient with a low pretest probability for significant or more advanced fibrosis, the clinician is asked to consider NILDA modifiers affecting the accuracy of the test (Table 7A) and consider a liver biopsy or longitudinal surveillance with NILDA.344",
      "The middle box at the top represents the “gray zone” for FIB-4 and NSF, and patients with results falling within those ranges should proceed with alternative strategies to determine the stage of fibrosis, including the possibility of a liver biopsy. The recommended cutoff value to identify the presence of significant or more advanced fibrosis using US-based LSM is around 7 to 8 kPa.67We decided to use a TE/SWE-LSM<8 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.1 kPa) when FIB-4 is≥1.3 (NAFLD) or≥1.45 (non-NAFLD) as an area of uncertainty, wherein patients will need to undergo further assessment. A TE/SWE-LSM of 8-11 kPa (or MRE-LSM 3.1-3.5 kPa) is compatible with at least significant fibrosis while not being able to rule out advanced fibrosis.341Such ranges are consistent with a recent large study proposing a TE-LSM≥9.1 kPa as the optimal threshold to detect significant fibrosis in the general population (≥9.5 kPa in patients with CLD risk factors).340Based on a large study not fulfilling criteria for our systematic review, we incorporated TE/SWE-LSM≥12 kPa and≥15 kPa as thresholds for the identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with specificities of 92% and 96%341(proposed corresponding MRE-LSM thresholds of≥3.6 kPa and≥4.7 kPa, respectively).",
      "Finally, the left-sided box inFigure 2Acorresponds to the highly specific cutoff values validated for the recognition of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 and NFS, specificity of 91% to 97%) or cirrhosis. With a blood-based fibrosis assessment that is predictive of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, a TE/SWE-LSM value<12 kPa (or MRE-LSM<3.6 kPa) would merit further study. In isolation, a result<12 kPa likely rules out cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD.303Under these circumstances, if a liver biopsy was viewed as undesirable, repeat imaging-based NILDA would help increase the certainty of the fibrosis estimates because it was demonstrated that 6-month apart longitudinal LSM values show increased accuracy over an isolated assessment.345,346TE/SWE-LSM values≥12 kPa (or MRE-LSM≥3.6 kPa) and≥15 kPa (or MRE≥4.7 kPa), would be more reliable in their prediction of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, when they occur in the presence of a blood-based NILDA that agrees versus when the latter falls within the indeterminate zone. In fact, both FIB-4≥3.25 and TE-LSM≥12 kPa are associated with a higher risk for HCC in treated HCV, even in the absence of histologically proven cirrhosis.347,348Among 871 patients with CLD, a TE-LSM≥13 kPa was used to identify occult cirrhosis with increased HCC risk.349Lastly, although a TE-LSM<20 kPa along with a platelet count≥150,000 has a very high NPV for the absence of varices at upper endoscopy, it is recommended for patients showing a TE/SWE-LSM≥20 kPa plus a platelet count<150,000 to undergo screening for esophageal varices as well as for patients with a TE/SWE-LSM≥25 kPa, irrespective of the platelet count.350For the identification of clinically significant PHTN, please see our systematic review and discussion.5,342A recent study showed PPV exceeding 90% when LSM was≥25 kPa across all etiologies, irrespective of platelet count.351Of note, MRE-LSM values above 5 kPa have a high risk for decompensation, need for liver transplantation, or death.352–354"

Multiple cutoff values for the identification of any degree of steatosis (≥5%) have been proposed for TE-CAP (median 274 [range 248-295] dB/m),57,303,308and in subjects with a low pretest probability of fatty liver disease, a cutoff of 270 dB/m rules out steatosis (AUROC 0.942) with a 100% NPV.313Meta-analyses identified that a TE-CAP threshold of 263 dB/m has a 90% sensitivity to rule out steatosis across different CLD diseases and found a threshold of≥275 dB/m as 79%-92% specific for ALD and NAFLD.8,308,355We selected 275 dB/m as a convenient threshold to screen for steatosis under most clinical circumstances (Figure 2B)."

      "Substantial progress has been made in the area of imaging-based NILDA. However, further research is needed. Although imaging-based NILDA are generally precise in estimating liver fibrosis, their availability for use in general practice is currently limited. As such, there is a need for broader awareness of the utility of imaging-based NILDA while considering (a) greater dissemination of testing in various clinical settings, (b) recognition of imaging-based NILDA accuracy by payors, and (c) hardware/software cost reduction. Populations with high risk for CLD (e.g., those showing components of the metabolic syndrome or untreated viral hepatitis) should be given priority for early access to imaging-based NILDA to facilitate diagnosis at the early stages of fibrosis and timely interventions. This is particularly true for the newly defined MAFLD given the a priori consideration of cardiometabolic criteria, which further selects for a higher risk of progressive liver disease, when compared to the previous NAFLD definition.14Importantly, the new steatotic liver disease diagnostic pathway needs further NILDA validation. Emerging tools such as machine learning could optimize imaging-based NILDA accuracy by considering clinical features and key blood tests readily accessible to any healthcare system.15The writing group summarized major areas for future research inTable 15. In the era of precision medicine, high-throughput technologies applied to experimental models will continue to generate a wealth of novel disease and injury-specific NILDA biomarkers for dynamic fibrosis assessment. Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multiomics databases will be challenging. Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard toward utilization of dynamic disease-specific models that are associated with clinical outcomes.",
      "TABLE 15 -Areas for future researchStudies on NILDA should include diverse populations.Comparative studies combining both blood-based and imaging-based tests performed synchronously and sequentially are needed to match clinical practice, with recognition of test utility by insurance and third-party payors.Prospective data on the diagnostic utility of simple and proprietary blood tests compared to imaging are needed. Ideally, validation studies should include paired comparisons with both imaging-based and blood-based tests from the same individual compared against liver histology (or if assessing fat, with histology or MRI-PDFF as reference).Further define the role of imaging-based NILDA in treated patients with HCV and HBV.Define the performance and threshold of imaging-based NILDA in MASLD.Additional studies are needed to further develop the assessment of hepatic inflammation either via US (i.e., use of shear wave dispersion slope)356or with alternative MRI methods (i.e., multiparametric iron-corrected T1 mapping [cT1]).357Regarding steatosis, additional studies comparing sonographic liver attenuation tools are needed, along with their potential combination in screening algorithms with blood-based NILDA. The role of US-based and MRI-PDFF/MRS to monitor changes in steatosis with therapies also merits further study.The diagnosis of NASH (not just fibrosis in NAFLD) represents a particular challenge for NILD,358,359and there is need for further study. Emerging MRE techniques, such as 3D MRER360and multifrequency acquisition,236,361show promising results in NASH and should be further evaluated.In light of these emerging data and the fact that NAFLD will soon become the primary indication for liver transplantation in adults, a reliable and validated method for detecting and quantifying steatosis in children to prevent sequelae in adulthood should be a priority.Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporation of demographics and a wide array of clinical data including genome-wide association studies, microbiome, and metabolomic tests to improve diagnosis and management of CLD.Research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA, including simplified algorithms across imaging-based modalities and expanded initiatives to further standardize LSM acquisition and quality reporting across manufacturers and across different disease etiologies, if needed.Study of novel approaches to reduce hardware/software costs necessary for widespread implementation of advanced imaging techniques is needed.Longitudinal studies of NILDA to assess the natural history of a disease, clinical outcomes, and changes with therapy are needed.Quantitative techniques and protocols for sequential use of NILDA for following fibrosis regression are needed. These could help better reflect scar regression given the ceiling effect (i.e., unique F4 stage irrespective of fibrosis thickness) imposed by standard pathology, which is not observed with collagen histomorphometry.Cost-effectiveness analysis studies will help determine appropriateness criteria of blood tests vs. imaging tests for fibrosis and/or steatosis detection in varied clinical scenarios (e.g., general population screening vs. at-risk populations).",
