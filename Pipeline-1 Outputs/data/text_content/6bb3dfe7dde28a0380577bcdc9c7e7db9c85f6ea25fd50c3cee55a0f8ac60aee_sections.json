The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases.Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.SourceAASLD AST Practice Guideline on Adult Liver Transplantation: Diagnosis and management of Graft-Related complicationsLiver Transplantation :  August 22, 2025Full-SizeEmail+ FavoritesExportView in GalleryEmail to ColleagueColleague's E-mail is InvalidYour Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).Message:Thought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw in Liver Transplantation.Your message has been successfully sent to your colleague.Some error has occurred while processing your request.

The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases.Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.SourceAASLD AST Practice Guideline on Adult Liver Transplantation: Diagnosis and management of Graft-Related complicationsLiver Transplantation :  August 22, 2025Full-SizeEmail+ FavoritesExportView in GalleryEmail to ColleagueColleague's E-mail is InvalidYour Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).Message:Thought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw in Liver Transplantation.Your message has been successfully sent to your colleague.Some error has occurred while processing your request.

The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases.Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.SourceAASLD AST Practice Guideline on Adult Liver Transplantation: Diagnosis and management of Graft-Related complicationsLiver Transplantation :  August 22, 2025Full-SizeEmail+ FavoritesExportView in GalleryEmail to ColleagueColleague's E-mail is InvalidYour Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).Message:Thought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw in Liver Transplantation.Your message has been successfully sent to your colleague.Some error has occurred while processing your request.

The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases.Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.SourceAASLD AST Practice Guideline on Adult Liver Transplantation: Diagnosis and management of Graft-Related complicationsLiver Transplantation :  August 22, 2025Full-SizeEmail+ FavoritesExportView in GalleryEmail to ColleagueColleague's E-mail is InvalidYour Name:Colleague's Email:Separate multiple e-mails with a (;).Message:Thought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw in Liver Transplantation.Your message has been successfully sent to your colleague.Some error has occurred while processing your request.

      "AbstractBackground and Aim: Advances in immunosuppression and surgical techniques in liver transplantation (LT) have significantly improved patient outcomes, but donor utilization and access to LT remain a challenge. The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. Methods: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk–benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Conclusion: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases."
