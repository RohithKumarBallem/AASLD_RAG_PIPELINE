This material may not be reproduced or distributed without written permission from the Association. Recommendation 1 For pregnant persons with HBV DNA levels greater than 200,000 IU/mL at any time point during pregnancy regardless of HBeAg status, AASLD recommends initiating tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) at gestational week 28 to prevent mother -to-child transmission. TDF has a more extensive safety record in pregnancy than TAF. Both entecavir and peginterferon use are contraindicated during pregnancy. (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty) IMPLEMENTATION TIP : For mothers with HBV DNA >200,000 IU/mL, if hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) use in infant is unavailable, initiate TDF/TAF prophylaxis at gestational week 16 in combination with subsequent infant vaccination Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Recommendation 2 For persons who are HBsAg -positive with viremia not meeting disease- specific treatment indications and who are in high- risk scenarios for transmission to others, AASLD suggests a shared decision- making approach regarding antiviral treatment. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty) IMPLEMENTATION TIP : If the primary indication for initiating antiviral therapy is for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission, the continuation of antiviral therapy may be revisited when transmission risks are no longer high Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. All rights reserved. This material may not be reproduced or distributed without written permission from the Association. Positive HBsAg with viremia - transmission prevention in high- risk settings Considerations for antiviral treatment for the main purpose to prevent onward transmission •HBV treatment to prevent onward transmission is not necessary for average risk scenarios for transmission* •Possible high -risk scenarios for horizontal transmission of HBV include persons who are engaging in unprotected sex or with mult iple partners, persons who are injecting drugs with inconsistent harm reduction practices, persons living with susceptible househo ld members and healthcare workers performing SHEA level III exposure -prone procedures •Utilize a shared decision -making approach to assess overall horizontal transmission risk and the individual‘s values and prefere nce regarding this risk and that of taking antivirals with the primary goal of preventing transmission to others •Decisions are influenced by the individual’s hepatitis B viremia, the exposure scenario and the vaccine and immunity status o f those who are potentially exposed: Situations favoring antiviral treatment of the viremic person include those where the person at risk for acquiring HBV is unvaccinated, has inadequate response to vaccine and/or has compromised immune systems,** or has unknown vaccine status •Providers should avoid stigmatizing practices and messages •Once initiated for the prevention of HBV transmission, antiviral therapy should be continued until the high risk of transmiss ion is no longer present •People starting antiviral therapy should be counselled regarding the risks of treatment cession, which may include severe liv er flares •Though there are no definitive studies on the lowest level of viral load transmissibility, *** the goal of HBV treatment is H BV DNA suppression to less than the lower limit of quantification *HBV is not transmitted from casual contact. People with hepatitis B should not be restricted in their daily activities, cont act sports, school activities or professional training, and should not be required to be treated in those settings. Within households, worksites, and other settings, it is important to emphasize that routine contact, sharing mea ls, and hugging are not considered routes of transmission, though sharing of personal hygiene items ( eg, toothbrush, razors) should be avoided **Groups known to have inadequate response to vaccine include those who have immunocompromising conditions, have diabetes, ha ve advanced liver disease, have advanced kidney disease, smoke, and are obese ***For healthcare providers performing Category III procedures, SHEA guidelines suggest maintaining HBV DNA < 1000 IU/mL Adapted from Table 2 in Ghany M., et al. AASLD Practice Guideline on Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B. Hepatology 2025 Case 3: Management of Persons in the Immune -tolerant Phase 42-year-old male is referred by his PCP for management of newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis B. Serologies reveal positive HBeAg, HBV DNA 10,880,000 IU/mL and ALT 32 U/L. FIB -4 noted to be 0.75. Vibration -controlled transient elastography (VCTE) with LSM of 5.6 kPa. As his ALT was 33 U/L 8 months ago, you determine that he is in the immune -tolerant phase. Which of the following factors in this patient would lead you to recommend antiviral therapy? A.Age > 40 years old B.FIB-4 score C.VCTE results D.HBV DNA >10 million IU/mL *LSM - liver stiffness measurement Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Recommendation 3 For persons in the immune -tolerant phase, the AASLD suggests antiviral therapy for those > 40 years or with significant liver inflammation (≥ grade 2) or fibrosis (≥ F2) on liver biopsy or noninvasive tests. For persons < 40 years old who are interested in starting treatment earlier, the AASLD suggests shared decision- making with consideration of risk factors as well as the benefits and risks of treatment. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty) IMPLEMENTATION TIP : Accurate identification of immune -tolerant phase requires persistently normal ALT levels (≥2 measurements at ≥ 6 months apart) with HBV DNA >107 IU/mL in HBeAg -positive persons Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Recommendation 4 In adults with HBsAg -positive, HBeAg -negative chronic HBV infection without cirrhosis and in the indeterminate phase, AASLD suggests antiviral therapy using a shared decision- making approach by assessing risks and benefits and to reevaluate that decision at each follow -up visit if treatment has not been initiated. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty) IMPLEMENTATION TIP : Individuals with persistently elevated ALT but HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL should be evaluated for other etiologies of liver injury and managed for those etiologies if found Copyright © 2025 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

AASLD Practice Guideline on Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B. Hepatology 2025 Singal A. G., et al. AASLD Practice Guidance on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatology 2023 Summary of Recommendations 1 For pregnant persons with HBV DNA levels greater than 200,000 IU/mL at any time point during pregnancy regardless of HBeAg status, AASLD recommends initiating tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) at gestational week 28 to prevent mother -to-child transmission (MTCT). TDF has a more extensive safety record in pregnancy than TAF. Both entecavir and peginterferon use are contraindicated during pregnancy. 2 For persons who are HBsAg -positive with viremia not meeting disease -specific treatment indications and who are in high -risk scenarios for transmission to others, AASLD suggests a shared decision - making approach regarding antiviral treatment. 3 For persons in the immune -tolerant phase, the AASLD suggests antiviral therapy for those > 40 years or with significant liver inflammation (≥ grade 2) or fibrosis (≥ F2) on liver biopsy or noninvasive tests. For persons < 40 years old who are interested in starting treatment earlier, the AASLD suggests shared decision -making with consideration of risk factors as well as the benefits and risks of treatment. 4 In adults with HBsAg -positive, HBeAg -negative chronic HBV infection without cirrhosis and in the indeterminate phase, AASLD suggests antiviral therapy using a shared decision -making approach by assessing risks and benefits and to reevaluate that decision at each follow -up visit if treatment has not been initiated.

Summary of Recommendations 5 In adults with chronic hepatitis B, who are HBeAg -negative without cirrhosis, with sustained undetectable HBV DNA on nucleos (t)ide analogue therapy, AASLD suggests not withdrawing nucleos (t)ide analogous therapy until HBsAg loss. 6 In persons who achieve HBsAg loss, AASLD suggests continued HCC surveillance for those with cirrhosis, with family history of HCC, men who experienced HBsAg loss after age 40, and women who experienced HBsAg loss after age 50. 7 In persons with HBV -HDV co -infection, AASLD suggests HCC surveillance of adults independent of cirrhosis status. The decision to undertake surveillance in children should be individualized due to the risk of HCC being unknown in this population. 8 In persons with HBV -HIV co -infection, AASLD suggests HCC surveillance for men ≥ 18 years of age and women ≥ 40 years of age. 9 In persons with HBV -HCV co -infection, AASLD recommends treatment for HCV and suggests HCC surveillance as per criteria for HBV mono -infection.

TDF has a more extensive safety record in pregnancy than TAF. Both entecavir and peginterferon use are contraindicated during pregnancy. 2 For persons who are HBsAg -positive with viremia not meeting disease -specific treatment indications and who are in high -risk scenarios for transmission to others, AASLD suggests a shared decision - making approach regarding antiviral treatment. 3 For persons in the immune -tolerant phase, the AASLD suggests antiviral therapy for those > 40 years or with significant liver inflammation (≥ grade 2) or fibrosis (≥ F2) on liver biopsy or noninvasive tests.",
