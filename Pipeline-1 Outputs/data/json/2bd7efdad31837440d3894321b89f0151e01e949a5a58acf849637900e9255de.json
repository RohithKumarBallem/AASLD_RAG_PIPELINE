Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.Results:For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Conclusions:Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Corresponding ArticleAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BGhany, Marc G.; Pan, Calvin Q.; Lok, Anna S.; Feld, Jordan J.; Lim, Joseph K.; Wang, Su H.; Kim, Arthur Y.; Tang, Amy S.; Nguyen, Mindie H.; Naggie, Susanna; Sulkowski, Mark S.; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Chen, J.; Murad, M.

Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.Results:For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Conclusions:Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Corresponding ArticleAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BGhany, Marc G.; Pan, Calvin Q.; Lok, Anna S.; Feld, Jordan J.; Lim, Joseph K.; Wang, Su H.; Kim, Arthur Y.; Tang, Amy S.; Nguyen, Mindie H.; Naggie, Susanna; Sulkowski, Mark S.; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Chen, J.; Murad, M.

Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.Results:For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Conclusions:Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Corresponding ArticleAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BGhany, Marc G.; Pan, Calvin Q.; Lok, Anna S.; Feld, Jordan J.; Lim, Joseph K.; Wang, Su H.; Kim, Arthur Y.; Tang, Amy S.; Nguyen, Mindie H.; Naggie, Susanna; Sulkowski, Mark S.; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Chen, J.; Murad, M.

Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.Results:For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Conclusions:Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Corresponding ArticleAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BGhany, Marc G.; Pan, Calvin Q.; Lok, Anna S.; Feld, Jordan J.; Lim, Joseph K.; Wang, Su H.; Kim, Arthur Y.; Tang, Amy S.; Nguyen, Mindie H.; Naggie, Susanna; Sulkowski, Mark S.; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Chen, J.; Murad, M.

Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.Results:For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares.

Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.Results:For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Conclusions:Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Corresponding ArticleAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BGhany, Marc G.; Pan, Calvin Q.; Lok, Anna S.; Feld, Jordan J.; Lim, Joseph K.; Wang, Su H.; Kim, Arthur Y.; Tang, Amy S.; Nguyen, Mindie H.; Naggie, Susanna; Sulkowski, Mark S.; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Chen, J.; Murad, M.

Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.Results:For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Conclusions:Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Corresponding ArticleAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BGhany, Marc G.; Pan, Calvin Q.; Lok, Anna S.; Feld, Jordan J.; Lim, Joseph K.; Wang, Su H.; Kim, Arthur Y.; Tang, Amy S.; Nguyen, Mindie H.; Naggie, Susanna; Sulkowski, Mark S.; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Chen, J.; Murad, M.

PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Conclusions:Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Corresponding ArticleAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BGhany, Marc G.; Pan, Calvin Q.; Lok, Anna S.; Feld, Jordan J.; Lim, Joseph K.; Wang, Su H.; Kim, Arthur Y.; Tang, Amy S.; Nguyen, Mindie H.; Naggie, Susanna; Sulkowski, Mark S.; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Chen, J.; Murad, M.

Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.Results:For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.Conclusions:Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.Corresponding ArticleAASLD/IDSA Practice Guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis BGhany, Marc G.; Pan, Calvin Q.; Lok, Anna S.; Feld, Jordan J.; Lim, Joseph K.; Wang, Su H.; Kim, Arthur Y.; Tang, Amy S.; Nguyen, Mindie H.; Naggie, Susanna; Sulkowski, Mark S.; Rodriguez-Baez, Norberto; Chen, J.; Murad, M.

PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients."

          "Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.",
